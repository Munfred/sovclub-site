The Haitian Revolution is the world's only successful slave uprising.  Occurring simultaneously with, and driven by, the French Revolution, it led to the second independent post-colonial state in the Americas.  I learned about the Haitian Revolution from Mike Duncan's excellent Revolutions podcast, and I'm ready to tell you all about it: [http://www.sal.wisc.edu/~​jwp/revolutions-episode-index.​html](http://www.sal.wisc.edu/~jwp/revolutions-episode-index.html)



The Haitian Revolution makes Games of Thrones look like one of Aesop's fables.  The dizzying number of parties (including big whites, small whites, free people of color, slaves, various parties in revolutionary France, Spain, Britain, USA), the shifting alliances between them, and the conflict between ideals and self-interest, combine to produce a rich and fascinating story.  It's not a simple story of slave vs. master, black vs. white, or France vs. Haiti.  It is all of those things, but also much, much more.  At the end of the revolution, the long-suffering ex-slaves finally lived in a stable, prosperous, and harmonious country with a bright future ahead of it...



Haha, just kidding!  This is Haiti, and nothing good ever happens in Haiti.  We'll talk about that, too.  Come hear about the Haitian Revolution this Wednesday at 6 pm Pacific: [https://caltech.zoom.​us/j/4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)



I've attached a copy of Jeremy Popkin's Concise History of the Haitian Revolution, if anyone wants to learn more.





Cheers,
