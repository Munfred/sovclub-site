So, I was planning to watch [The Comey Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvPTCvUnNQA) today, but it turns out Valentine already watched it. Then, since there is a brand [new war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) brewing, I thought it would be great to watch something about Nagorno-Karabakh. Much to my delight, wikipedia lists not one, not two, but [eight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Nagorno-Karabakh_War_films) movies about the conflict. But, (un)surprisingly, you can't get access to any of them. So much for the internet.



So as a last resort, we will be watching [Borat, the 2006 movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4W51ndJ8Mc). There is a [second one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvPTCvUnNQA) coming out in a few weeks, so maybe we'll get around to it at some point.



See you in 10 minutes at [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/â€‹4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)
