It is a universally acknowledged truth that most of what humans say, do and think is total crap, but that occasionally they come up with some pretty good and insightful stuff, and occasionally that stuff gets preserved and passed down for generations and aeons, their wordsÂ  become "classics" and they are deemed "wise".Â 



One way to become "wise" is to read the good stuff that those "wise" people said - not some hodgepodge hufflepuff contemporary other dumb person who is explaining to you what those "wise" people said.Â 



This being a club about countries, in order to become "wise" about countries it makes sense that we should pay attention to the words of people that did "good" things with countries - well, things we like, with countries.Â 



The thing is, not a lot of people did "good" things with countries, and even less of them did write at length, and most importantly, candidly (to an extent, since in this job line there's quite a bit of anti-candor-selection-â€‹pressure).



So tonight we will talk about people who did "good" things with countries and wrote something with at least some candor. Join us officially unofficially at 5PM (next week we will finally get a full moon and it will be officially official! Also you should get your appendages to the constitution by then!)



And here is the still-expanding list of people and things they wrote, sorted by reverse alphabetical order of the penultimate letter of their first name.
