Leadership is tough. Leadership through times of crisis and ambiguity is doubly tough. Leadership through times of multiple compounding global tidal waves can seem impossible. To refer back to [the liquid reality discussion](https://www.caltechsovereignty.club/liquid-reality/), the world is in a new box that we don't understand yet. The world is in a new box that it barely understands yet. We've only mapped out a small corner of this box and have just started exploring the rest of the vast dark patches. It will take some time.

¬†

What's more, our club members need us more than ever. The best thing we can do for them is add to the ambiguity. Sovclub historically has been great at not setting clear expectations across the organization and I think this is starting to cause an enormous amount of derp that's getting a life of its own.

¬†

I can't tell you how to do that in your various discussions. But a good start would be to remind everyone that we are a club. More importantly, we are a hugely ambitious one. We are trying to create a world polity that gives superpowers to the peoples of the world that we are obsessed over. Everything Sovclub does is to accomplish this, and everyone at Sovclub should be able to describe how their bulshitting, through a series of direct or indirect steps, furthers this mission.

¬†

To help you make this more clear to your club members, here are some pointers about what Sovclub is not:

¬†

Sovclub, like any other student club company, is not a family. The very idea is preposterous. You are born into a family. You never choose it, and they can't un-family you. It should be massively obvious that Sovclub is not a family but I see people casually use terms like "Sovfam" which will cause the members of our teams (especially ones that gullibly walked into this club without knowing what they were getting into) to get the wrong impression. The dangers of "family thinking" are that it becomes incredibly hard to have political discussions over thanksgiving dinner. Sovclub is a club, not a family.

¬†

We literally only want the derpiest people in the world, but we can't discriminate so everyone is welcome. The reason why you joined Sovclub is because ‚Äî I hope ‚Äî all the other people you met during the club fair or discussions were really smart, derpy, and couldn't stop talking. This is magic and it creates a virtuous magnetism on derpy people because very few people in the world have this in themselves. People who don't wouldn't want to be part of this club anyway. This magic and magnetism is a club with lax performance management that I expect all of us to get back to.

¬†

Sovclub is also not the government, yet. We cannot solve every societal problem here, but we sure as hell would like to, and cause some others just for fun. We are part of an ecosystem, of economies, of culture, and of actual countries. We also can't take care of all your needs. We will try our best to take care of the ones that ensure you can support our mission, like beer, pizza and political news. Sovclub's worldview is well documented ‚Äî we believe in pretty much anything, if you dig deep enough. Sometimes we [see opportunities to help nudge causes forward](https://bucketeer-d1171d9d-37c5-4064-a02c-0f004258aa46.s3.amazonaws.com/8ybTs2dUWHbBQnEMyouXAFs5). We do this not because it directly helps our club and our members but because of some moralistic overreach or just because it's fun or a good joke.

¬†

We want to build one or more of the best countries in the world. We obsess about countries. We want everyone to have a shot at bettering their lot through nation building. We want to make and keep Sovclub's, the club, world class or die trying.

¬†

Only way to do this is through having incredible people. Some of them join us during clubfair, and we help them but expect them to grow into their potential. Some of them join us while looking for the bathroom. But we all have to read the emails for our discussions every week. The red-queen race of Sovclub's historic growth is that everyone has to show up at least a bit derpier every meeting to qualify for our expectations. I expect you to hold yourself and your friends to this standard. Judge this improvement based on having a derpy mindset, deepening the craft, taking risks, making better jokes, and doing what it takes to better support our mission and our bullshit.

¬†

We will always have compassion for club members, peoples and countries in truly difficult situations, although from the jokes and all the tough love it might not be apparent. For example, those who find themselves suddenly graduating or those who are struggling with political issues because they actually care. There are also second chances, and third chances, and nth chances, no matter how much you break our heart. But especially if you are Dylan we need to remind everyone that like any other club, it matters how you show up every week and have a good time. Beyond straight derpyness, everyone that engages in endless sovchat trolling, victimhood thinking, us-vs-them divisiveness, and zero sum thinking should get a hi-five: as long as they make good jokes, or even if they don't. Clubs survive and thrive on the actions of the collective, and the (in)cohesiveness of the whole. Poor jokes and political rants should be endorsed.

¬†

If this sounds at all surprising, this is because we somehow made something out of a long running joke. Sovclub has always been like this, honestly since the first meeting we had a good thing going. I feel that a lot of these core jokes have been made better over recent years. So in my capacity as the one person who has witnessed every meeting of Sovclub's existence, aside from that one time I was in Hawaii, I want to reiterate some of these core jokes. Sovclub is as successful as it is right now precisely because of the downstream effects of those early jokes. Currently we are successful despite the bad jokes and all the zoom fatigue. This will not work for much longer. Let's get back there.

¬†

Despite all the external buzz around Sovclub (pizza, beer, derpiest club in Caltech...) we are still really early. We are in the small leagues leagues compared to the biggest and baddest countries, institutions, and cults in the world. When we succeed in our mission, millions of people will do better. Millions of people will have a good time. We have the opportunity to make that tens and even hundreds of millions in the future. I'm here for this potential, and I need you to be here for that too.

OK, that's a lot to take in. You might be tempted to take what's up there and run it through some kind of lowpass filter and translate it into your own language before discussing it with your peers and your friends. Do it. Above is what I need everyone to understand. It's not important not to muddy a message that fights against the muddying of jokes. You are responsible for reinforcing these lessons and holding your friends accountable to them. Join us tonight at 6PM at [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/‚Äã4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668). Even better, actively contribute to the discussion with ideas and opportunities to implement these ideas. This is what leadership in action looks like.
