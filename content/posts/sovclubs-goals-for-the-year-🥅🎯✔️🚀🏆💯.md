**SovClub’s goals for the year.**

If you have ideas on what to do and how to do it, please join us.

\===

**PS: Exceptionally this Sunday at 2 pm PST on Zoom we will have James Daltrey from [Living Stoicism](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=9c4812be9f&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!6D7Ui2-kORuYqx6CXLpapCIb7HUVsTDTkoE0eGIdsaBEIYuVVVK_sCLftyF71LAsxXzxYog77MB9hQgt_F2VsEswxO-W6w$) talking about How Stoic ethics arises from their idea of the divine.**

James is a self proclaimed nerd and naturalist that abides by the socratic tenant of being Judged by what he says and does. He has a background in engineering and materials science, currently working on language and linguistics. People keep asking him "how can Stoicism be squared with modern thinking" his question is "How can Stoicism inform modern thinking".

🥅🎯✔️🚀🏆💯
