Back in the days of the #bestempire, right around the time most other #lamerempires were falling apart, one charismatic subject of the empire did such a great job hastening their fall and [writing about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Pillars_of_Wisdom) that they made a major epic historical drama about him.



Tonight we watch the first half of [Lawrence of Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_of_Arabia_(film)).



See you in 3 hours
