Michael pointed out to me that much like [cats](http://pbs.org/newshour/science/answering-the-question-that-won-me-the-ig-nobel-prize-are-cats-liquid) and the [grey goo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_goo), demand for sovclub is completely elastic and will expand to fill whatever amount of time is available. By which I mean that, getting the meetings started at 5pm did not mean that they ended an hour early (if anything it seems to have had the opposite effect?). So anyway, tonight's bullshit will start at the sacred 6PM cartime time. YEAH. I KNOW. All that constitutional amendment drama was for *nothing**.



Anyhows. As some of you may know these past days I've been helping organize the [Caltech Y Science Policy Symposium](https://sass.caltech.edu/sps), so I didn't have time to prepare anything. On the other hand, I did help prepare a [billion review materials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSVyYWibJkGpuYVE82yOMnGAJDZLDm9PfIaDnEQM9trQjAHXon9UCJSrji5xo7YR98PW2SGD1GmcGhD/pub)\*\*, so I'm basically an expert. Perhaps tonight we could discuss these two articles from [Bill Colglazier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Colglazier), who is an awesome physicist trained at Caltech who now does [science diplomacy](https://www.sciencediplomacy.org/about)\*\**. Here they are:\

See you at 6PM: [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)

In Sovereignty,

\*I mean who am I kidding we all know the drama is an end in itself.



\*\*If you care about tech regulation I highly recommend this article: [New Digital Realities; New Oversight Solutions in the U.S. - The Case for a Digital Platform Agency and a New Approach to Regulatory Oversight](https://shorensteincenter.org/new-digital-realities-tom-wheeler-phil-verveer-gene-kimmelman/)



\*\**Yes I'm thinking things.
