**Humanity‚Äôs coordinating systems\
(and what Protocol Labs is doing to improve them)****\

COORDINATION is the biggest challenge we as humankind face. Our inability to coordinate is the reason why so often, we act against our collective interests by acting towards individual interests that end up making¬†**everyone**¬†worse off. It is the reason why so often people cannot act on issues everyone agrees is a problem, why citizens enable democracies to be despotic, the reason why countries cannot come together to solve global warming.

**The challenge of coordination is two-fold.**

First: we must design mechanisms - the ‚Äúrules of the game‚Äù - that align individual and collective interests such that players, acting selfishly, will achieve an outcome that makes everyone better off. An example would be market economies, which only work because in reality they operate in a very regulated environment, where governments will often update the rules to reduce behaviors that clearly make everyone worse off. Another example of mechanism is¬†[quadratic voting¬†](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=cc179a0bc2&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!-b6TVwarkpLoyy_Q873aGxIM9-peP0DaqXCyEqKTY-KA7aIdlAz1jsLBGXKorJpwrSzidrVI17doIzVXQtBdVpaD98Ckzw$)in grant matchmaking, where grants are distributed proportionally to the square of the sum of the square root of individual donations to each project, so as to avoid influence dominance by a few big donors.

Second: given a set of rules - such as the laws of a society - we must implement tools that lower the cost of coordinating behaviors that have collectively desirable outcomes. For example, lowering the cost of voting in elections increases voter turnout and improves government accountability. Crowdfunding was never really illegal under US law, but only became game changing after online platforms made it frictionless. Digital communication platforms enable many individuals to coordinate in grassroots movement to successfully challenge fewer but more powerful individuals and institutions.

**Coordination is hard, even with the internet**

The internet and communication technologies were tremendous improvements to our abilities to coordinate as individuals. Yet existing tools and platforms fall very short from what technology could enable for coordination and agency. For example, most social media tools are deliberately designed to not afford us sustained focus on any one thing, and to preclude efficient management of information and communication. And while other digital platforms we use may not espouse such deliberate crippling, almost all of them share an equally limiting aspect: they are walled gardens, keeping us from easily getting data in or out, and not offering any kind of interoperability with other digital platforms.

The dire consequence is that our digital selves - the collection of information about our mostly on-line behaviors - is splintered beyond usefulness, intentionally so. Our inability to organize, manage and analyze our digital selves profoundly cripples our lives in the digital age, and we don't even realize it. One need look no further than the myriad of different chat applications that we need to use to keep in touch with our full circle of acquaintances, making it impossible to search, organize and manage conversations, and imposing a significant burden through constant context switching. Without tools to manage our digital selves, we go by instinct, relying on what evolution bequeathed us, when over a lifetime we'd meet a few hundred people - not over a month or a week. No wonder it's so hard to coordinate with others for more than a pizza party.

**Whew! Coordination looks hard enough to do on an individual basis! What about coordination between groups? Between institutions? Between governments? Countries? The whole of humankind?!**What are humanitiy‚Äô's coordinating systems? Like an OS, but‚Ä¶for getting humankind‚Äôs shit together? Finance, democracy, the internet, SMPT, bayesian statistics‚Ä¶

What are the systems we created to get our shit together and act cohesively in creating the future we want? And what are the systems we¬†*could*¬†create to do what waaaay better than the present (rather low) bar?
