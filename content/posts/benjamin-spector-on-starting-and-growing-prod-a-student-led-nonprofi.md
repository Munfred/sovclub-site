This Wednesday at 6pm our speaker will be Benjamin Spector, a recent MIT graduate and now Stanford grad student in machine learning. In 2021 Ben created Prod ([https://www.prod.so/](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=eb5fe3c0ab&e=09f1ce99cf)) a student run non-profit organization started at MIT and Harvard that aims to convince graduating students to devote their loves to doing cool and meaningful things, as opposed to optimizing ads for Facebook or making more money for hedge funds. This is done through mentorship, hackathons, regular meetings, social events and workshops that get people thinking about what to do with their life. Despite being only one year old, prod already has a remarkable track record: 40 students participated in the first year programs, started companies that collectively raised more than $25M and are valued at $240M. Ben is not president of Prod anymore - Ben addressed the succession problem and has a bunch of motivated students running the show. Ben is now eyeing what comes next: how to start chapters and cohorts in universities across the US.\
\
Ben will tell us the story of Prod, what motivated him to start Prod, how he grew community, the many challenges along the way, and how he inspired people to take over after him. If you are thinking about creating your own organization, whether it is a student club, a company or a nonprofit that will expand across many places, Ben will have a lot of valuable lessons to share!
