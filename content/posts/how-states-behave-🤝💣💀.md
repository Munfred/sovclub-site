**Above**: Famous realist John J. Mearsheimer [criticizing liberals](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=b428c398a2&e=5b1b355c7c) for dragging the West into unwinnable wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He argues, among other things, that social engineering is hard; that nationalism makes conquest difficult; and that most people value stability over rights.



What explains how states interact with each other? Do they each seek to maximize their own power relative to other states, as [realists](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=6b1a1f7d47&e=5b1b355c7c) would have it? Or do states also care about the mutual benefits of international cooperation, which are enhanced by international institutions, democracy, and trade, as [liberals](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=348b0e54ac&e=5b1b355c7c) would have it? Or maybe ideology is important and the national interest is socially constructed rather than purely material, as the [constructivists](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=e49c41e27b&e=5b1b355c7c) would have it. We'll talk about the main international relations theories--realism, liberalism, constructivism--and their successes and failures at explaining the most significant historical events, like WWI and the Cold War.

For added spice, I’ll throw in my own half-serious pet theory, which says that all of the above theories are bullshit because governments pursue foreign policy to satisfy the self-centered and short-sighted goals of their supporters rather than upholding anything resembling a national interest. Example: Menelaus going to war against Troy to get his wife Helen back. Which probably never happened, because it’s a legend, hence the half-seriousness.
