This week, we continue our World Religions series, where we invite clergy from the world's most influential religions to tell us about their faith.  On Wednesday, we will complete our tour of the major Abrahamic faiths by hearing about the beliefs and history of Islam from [Marc Manely](http://www.marcmanley.com/ "http\://www.marcmanley.com/"), who is an imam, writer, and Religious Director at [Middle Ground](https://muslim.center/ "https\://muslim.center/").  My half-Afghan friend, formerly Muslim but now [Baháʼí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith "https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith"), says he is a great speaker; hopefully we'll get to hear her perspective as well.  

The speaker will aim for a 20-30 minute presentation, with 30-40 minutes for discussion.  Bring your questions, including difficult ones!  This isn't a madrasa class, but neither is it a debate or an interfaith dialogue.  Don't agree just to be agreeable, or disagree just to be disagreeable.  I look forward to a lively discussion, with free pizza for those who join in person!
