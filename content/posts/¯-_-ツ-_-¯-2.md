Sorry I didn't get around to formally preparing anything for this week. However, I invited [Alex K. Chen](https://twitter.com/InquilineKea) to join us, and I think he will so that'll be interesting.



Also, a Caltech alumni saw the discussion topic from last week and emailed me saying we should invite [Norris Krueger](https://www.norriskrueger.com/) (also an alumni) to discuss that idea, so I'll get around to that at some point!



Programming note: Brener called dibs on the discussion for August 11, so buckle up.



See you at 6PM at [https://caltech.zoom.us/my/​sovcall](https://caltech.zoom.us/my/sovcall)



In sovereignty,



Eduardo
