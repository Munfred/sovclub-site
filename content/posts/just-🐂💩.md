These past days have been pretty busy (defending Friday October 29 at 3pm on our zoom link!). Sadly I couldn't devote time to coming up with a topic (not was anyone yearning to present something) so we'll just have to wing it today.



On the upside, there is still time to make it to the acknowledgements of my [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AFsJQTA_8bNlPt4LidNFdU0rNfODQoFz/view?usp=sharing), just show up to sovcall and make a contribution!



See you tonight at 6PM: [https://caltech.zoom.us/​my/sovcall](https://caltech.zoom.us/my/sovcall)



In sovereignty,



Eduardo



PS: I recently learned about  [Mikheil Saakashvili](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikheil_Saakashvili), and wow Xenocracy at work! I'm a fan. Did grad school in the US, third president of Georgia for two consecutive terms, awesome guy, part lost power to corrupt opposition who tries to arrest him on charges of corruption,  flees to Ukraine where he supports the pro-European union protests, gets Ukranian citizenship, is made governor of random Oblast in danger of falling to Russia everyone was afraid of touching, Georgia strips him of citizenship, then 2 years in gets mad at Ukraine for being bad at freedom and they revoke his Ukranian citizenship and he becomes stateless, so he hangs out in US a while, and [last friday went to Georgia and was arrested smiling, ahead of elections](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/03/saakashvili-arrest-tests-georgias-shaky-democracy/) - a publicly stunt to get his party to win. Here's an [awesome 3 min video where he talks about some interactions with Putin](https://www.bbc.com/reel/playlist/bbc-select?vpid=p09vz59f) and [here's an awesome 25 min interview with Al Jazeera you should totally watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slvuzs_NYoU), he is a total badass unafraid of dying upholding the things he believes in.
