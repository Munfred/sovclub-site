Two things might surprise you about today's topic:

1. That we have 87 people in the sovmailinglist to be breathing this on the first place
2. That [there is a campaign with ~$6500 left to go](https://www.catarse.me/ivgpodecrer)

How did we get here?



It all began with the great lockdown and Eduardo going back to live a sabbatical year at the beach. But if you really want the whole story, remember about when we talked about [institutional advancement ](https://www.caltechsovereignty.club/institutional-advancement)and how to solve the world's problems. Then after that, [check the campaign](https://www.catarse.me/ivgpodecrer). If you don't like reading, [just watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYYTFfDzPkE). Then we can talk.\
\
Tonight I will share with you what I've learned since then, what I'm thinking, and where we're going. \

Oh, and if Brener shows up he might also regale us with a story about Banana Media
