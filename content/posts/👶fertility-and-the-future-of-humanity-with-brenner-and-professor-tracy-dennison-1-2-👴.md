This is part 1 of 2 on the demographic future of humanity.Â  This week, Brenner will present his apocalyptic visionðŸ’¥, and Tracy Dennison will join the discussion.Â  Next week, Tracy will present and Brenner will be in the audience.Â  Tracy is aÂ Caltech professor of Social Science History, who taught a class on demographics last quarter.Â  She is also our club's advisor.Â 

Brenner's talk:

*Numerous damaging forces are contributing to the dramatic decline in sperm counts in Western countries and the alarming rise in reproductive health problems in men and women. These influences are also poisoning other species and the ecosystems that we share. As a species we are failing to propagate and repopulate ourselves, and we are hindering the ability of others species to do so. These shifts have many potential consequences for societies.*
