Hello sovclubers,



This Wednesday--for real this time--we'll have a guest speaker, [Elizabeth Krider](https://www.oak-crest.org/board/elizabeth-krider/ "https\://www.oak-crest.org/board/elizabeth-krider/").  Krider used to be Caltech's science lobbyist, and is now an independent consultant on science policy and academic research issues.  She'll tell us how to make people like us and give us money so that ~~![☢](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/2622)️we can set up a Mars base and conquer Earth![🌍](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f30d)~~~~![🌎](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f30e)~~ continue doing research for the good of humanity.



Have any crazy ideas about how science should be done?  Bring them.  Don't have any crazy ideas?  Come listen to Krider say reasonable things instead, in a break with sovclub tradition.



See you Wednesday at [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668), 6PM PDT!  We'll have our usual bullshit period, but it'll end at 6:30 SHARP, and then Krider will talk to us.
