**Above:**Â A city, compared to a neuron. Are the similarities merely coincidental?



We live in a universe in which complex patterns emerge on different physical scales. In this talk James Tyrwhitt-Drake will describe how recurring patterns in living systems can be used to understand cells, organisms, and cities as instances of a single phenomena with a common set of evolutionary restraints guiding their behavior. These principles can be used to understand the nature and behavior of states. This analysis will be conducted through the lens of systems theory and materialist ontology; the study of cohesive groups of interconnected components, and the principle that all phenomena are composed of matter and energy.
