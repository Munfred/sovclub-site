Hey everybody,



I'll be presenting tonight on the history of Christianity in Kenya charting its impact through the colonial and post-colonial periods and how it has shaped Kenyan lives and experiences to date. There's lots of ground to cover so I'll mostly focus on the coming of the missionaries, the colonial period, the Mau Mau uprising, and the struggle for independence, and finally, the role of Christianity in Kenya today drawing on some of my own experiences.



No need to do any readings in preparation, but I'll suggest a few readings at the end of my presentation for those who'd want to know more.



Cheers,



Albert
