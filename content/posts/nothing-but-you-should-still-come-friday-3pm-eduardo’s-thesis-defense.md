Tonight we will again test a hypothesis that is getting increasingly harder to refute: is sovclub more popular when nobody prepares anything? And is it \*especially\* popular when Eduardo doesn't show up? Let's find out!Â 



Because indeed nobody has prepared anything, and I am actually landing in the worst airport on earth around 6:20. So you can probably enjoy a full 30 minutes without me, maybe even more!Â 



Between Thursday and Sunday I'll be hanging around Caltech and meeting up with people, so if you want to chat, let me know! I'll be mostly around Chen building, so you can also try to find me there.Â 



And Friday 3pm is my thesis defense, so if youâ€™re around in person you should attend, and if you're not you should just hop on zoom anyway! Details below





Title: Stories in Single Cell RNA Sequencing



Date: Friday, October 29, 3pm

Physical location: Chen 100

Cyber location:Â [https://caltech.zoom.us/my/â€‹sovcall](https://caltech.zoom.us/my/sovcall)Â 



Synopsis: During my time at Caltech I made many friends, and worked on many projects, experimental and computational, from methods development to data analysis. The common theme is that they are all about single cell RNA sequencing, and could not have been completed without the many wonderful people I met along the grad school journey. In this talk I will tell you about the stories of 8 such projects.Â

PS: if you are around In December 4-5 you might be interested in attention the Foresight Institute's Vision Weekend, which will happen in San Francisco at the Internet Archive!Â Â [https://foresight.org/vision-â€‹weekend-2021/](https://foresight.org/vision-weekend-2021/)



It is Foresight's annual member gathering to discuss things about the future on the intersection of several topics: biotech, nanotech, neurotech, computing, crypto-things and space.Â 



Foresight is an extremely legit discussion group that has been going strong in the bay area for several decades and has influenced a lot of modern technology. I've been attending the meeting this year (mostly on zoom) and they have really good speakers. I've been asked by their top brass to invite the smart people from Caltech that I know (yes you're the best that I have, sorry to disappoint). They also offered subsidized tickets here:Â

If you think you're penny-less but extra special, I'll put you in touch with them so you may plea for even cheaper tickets.Â 



Also if you decide to come and stay longer, I will be offering free lodging at my soon-to-be new abode in Redwood City (about 30 min by car from San Francisco)
