Last time, the Roman Republic fell into a civil war between Marius and Sulla. Mithridates VI of Pontus killed all Roman and Italian citizens in his territory on a single day, causing Rome to declare war. Sulla led an army against Mithridates, only to be recalled by a Marius-controlled assembly. Instead, Sulla led his army against Rome, purged his opponents, and then went off to fight Mithridates. Marius took control of the capital again. After Sulla defeated Mithridates, he marched on Rome a second time--this time fighting the Marian faction's hostile armies--and emerged victorious. After proclaiming himself dictator for life, he posted lists of hundred of his enemies in the forum, promising to reward anyone who killed them. After Sulla's death, Pompey conquered the rich lands of Syria and Asia Minor, doubling Rome's revenues. Crassus, the richest man in Rome, put down Spartacus' slave rebellion--only for Pompey to swoop in and kill the scattered remnants of the slave army, thus claiming most of the glory. Pompey and Crassus use their respective armies to get themselves appointed consuls: the consulship of Pompey and Crassus (70 BC).



Today, we finish the story of the Republic's collapse with some of the most famous people to ever live: Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, Augustus, Mark Anthony. If you've ever heard these quotes, they are all from Julius Caesar:



> Crossing the Rubicon
>
> ālea iacta est -- The die is cast
>
> "Veni vidi vici" -- I came, I saw, I conquered
>
> Et tu, Brute? -- You too, Brutus? \[apocryphal]
>
> The Ides of March

Next week, we'll wrap up the series by exploring why the Republic fell, and taking a look at the empire that replaced it. Should Eduardo's dire pessimism about the American Republic prove true, it might also be a glimpse into our future.
