Few will recognize thisÂ [Armenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_alphabet "https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_alphabet")Â hello--unless you've been toÂ [Glendale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Armenian_Americans_in_Los_Angeles "https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Armenian_Americans_in_Los_Angeles")!

So why are there 100kÂ Armenians living off the 134? As we heard in Sov Club onÂ [Oct 7](https://www.caltechsovereignty.club/a-bit-of-struggle/ "https\://www.caltechsovereignty.club/a-bit-of-struggle/"), Azerbaijan andÂ ArmeniaÂ foughtÂ a 6-yearÂ [existential conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nagorno-Karabakh_War "https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nagorno-Karabakh_War")Â in the 90s thatÂ wiped out theÂ Armenian economy, spurring many to sunny SoCal. Broken but not defeated, the newÂ Armenian Republic established de facto military control over the "Nagorno Karabakh"Â Armenian enclave and the surrounding Azeri territories, despite Azerbaijan's sovereignty de jure.

Last year everything changed.

In 44 days, Azerbaijan regained all lost territories and established control over much ofÂ Armenian-populated Karabakh. It wasÂ [ugly](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/15/two-men-beheaded-in-videos-from-nagorno-karabakh-war-identified "https\://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/15/two-men-beheaded-in-videos-from-nagorno-karabakh-war-identified")Â andÂ [attacksÂ ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59308602 "https\://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59308602")continue despite a Russian-brokered peace deal.

While theÂ [Western media](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/world/europe/nagorno-karabakh-armenia-azerbaijan.html "https\://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/world/europe/nagorno-karabakh-armenia-azerbaijan.html")Â dismissed this war as an "eruption" of violence fueled by romantic nationalism, an honest look reveals methodical preparation for this war and opportune timing by Azerbaijan. Despite the intense sense of tragedy that we feel asÂ Armenians, we recognize that Azerbaijan taught us a lot about how to win the game of sovereignty in the Caucasus in the 21st century (spoiler: drones are kind of important).

In our talk, we explore how the game of sovereignty evolved over the past couple millennia and how, despite the uniqueness of our times, some winning strategies have remained the same.Â Join us tonight from 6 - 7pm on Zoom ([https://caltech.zoom.us/my/sovcall](https://caltech.zoom.us/my/sovcall.))--first half bs, second half talk.



Honorably,
