Tomorrow at noon I will be hosting Cory Doctorow for a conversation about tech and society. Cory is a science fiction writer and anti IP activist, he is cool (Valentine described knowing him as "the center of the internet back in the Boing Boing days". That's how you know it's gonna be good ;p ).



I'm copying the event info below, you should sign up!

The Caltech Y Student Activism Speaker Series (SASS)

What Technology Does, Who It Does It For, and Who It Does It To

A Conversation with Cory Doctorow

Friday | April 2nd | 12-1 PM PST | Via Zoom

The "technological utopians" are a semi-mythical ancient tribe of people who thought that networked, digital tools would give self-determination to communities and individuals so that they could be their true selves and organize for a better world. The utopian dream was true, but incomplete, as today, the technology we use is far more likely to take away self-determination and incinerate pluralism and choice. What went wrong? How do we make it right again? A talk about monopoly, interoperability, remote attestation, the difficulties of Rene Descartes, and the transformation of the internet into five giant websites, each filled with screenshots of text from the other four.
