So it seems that, somewhat incidentally, there's been kind of..a theme to sovwatch? UN me, then Oil for Food, then Vice, which is about a guy that played a big role in invading Iraq and getting all the Oil for Food records safely stored to that they could be looked at and cause a massive scandal.



Then in the Vice movie, there was this [kinda assholeyish guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmoO4wLJ5sA) that I really liked. And, turns out, [they made a an actual documentary about him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unknown_Known). And, even better, turns out the entire video is on the [internet archive](https://archive.org/details/The_Unknown_Known) (and [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/70292939)) so we don't even have to pirate it.



So, tomorrow, 5PM cartime, we will be watching *The Unknown Known.*



Join us! [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/‚Äã4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)



In sovereignty,

PS: Austin throwed out there the idea of starting a *sovbooklub* which I really liked because I've been actually reading books lately. And the first book we decided to read is [World Order](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MQA5OO4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), by [that guy.](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-Kissinger) The exact format of *sovbooklub* is still undefined, it will depend on how many people join us. So let me know if you want in!
