The banananification of the world continues in full force, faster than the gray goo, spreading all over the continent. Not even the northernmost regions, previously believed to have cold-induced resistance, [are spared](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jody-wilson-raybould-trudeau-1.6172488). 



This rapid spread is exacerbated by seismoc banana waves emanating from the epicenter of it all. The embananation is over 9000. More has happened in two days than many thought possible in a year. 



Tonight we devote our meeting to explaining these accelerating banana processes, which most of you [missed because you blinked](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/05/bolsonaro-september-7-brazil-trump-january-6/). 



We will be joined by Michael and James, who will help us understand the newcomer to the ever less selective Banana club, and by Brener, who will help us understand the banana singularity that happened last week.

PS: Attending today will also afford you the unique opportunity of influencing global politics by telling James in who to vote. Xenocracy at work!
