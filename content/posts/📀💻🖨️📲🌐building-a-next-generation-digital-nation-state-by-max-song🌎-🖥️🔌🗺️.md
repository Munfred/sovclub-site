Questions of the individual relationship to the state have been debated and negotiated since the dawn of human civilization - though in the last few weeks, this is more important than ever. What if we could build a new nation-state from the ground up? What "primitives" of self-sovereignty, of privacy, of taxation, of opt-in and opt-out, of membership, citizenship, taxes, monopoly on force, will be considered? What if the nation was "digital born"? What rules would be followed and not followed?
