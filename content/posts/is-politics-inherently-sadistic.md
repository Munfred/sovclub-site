Politics is, it seems, primarily, about winning. Not about the people, making the world a better place, or morals.\
\
It is often described as machiavellian, after Machiavelli’s advice from [The Prince](https://ia802304.us.archive.org/27/items/princemac00machuoft/princemac00machuoft_bw.pdf). According to [Elsevier](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/machiavellianism), a specialist in the topic:



>  Machiavellianism is associated with the doctrine of moral expediency and deviousness in political actions; the divorce of  politics from private morality; and the justification of all political means, even the most unscrupulous when the interests of the state are at stake. Machiavellianism is generally interpreted as an immoral doctrine, and so is used as a term of reproach and dishonor. But Machiavelli’s arguments have also been seen as recognition of the realities of political life, and so some view Machiavellianism as amoral, objective, or descriptive, rather than immoral. Contemporary writers grappling with the problem of the need for ‘dirty hands’ in politics see in Machiavellianism a justification for a morality appropriate to political actions, different from principles that govern private life. Machiavelli’s enduring contribution to political thought and practice is the remarkably resilient idea that politics involves the transcendence or violation of ordinary moral principles; that fraud, force, lies, and violence are justified because they are necessary for political success.

The real irony of Machiavellianism is its simultaneous denouncement (see above) and [glorification](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/02/the-dirty-trickster). Do people even understand how they feel about it?



However, it seems that a distinct, totally non machiavellian driver of politics, is the satisfaction derived from [making people cry](https://twitter.com/BillyCorben/status/1351990647658573830). Also, [making other people cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ranhDLpnIqg).  Also, [making money from people crying](https://liberaltears.net/). And [consulting on how to make people cry](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/02/the-dirty-trickster).



So, is politics inherently sadistic? Or is it mostly amoral, as one would think from Machiavelli’s advice?\
