Sorry for the extra late notice, I was kidnapped to go on a cachaça quest. 

Tonight (i.e. now) we will be watching the second part of the 2003 movie/two-part miniseries Julius Caesar. The second half runs for about 90 minutes. 

See you now at https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668

PS: This Wednesday we will continue with our Brazil series, part 2
