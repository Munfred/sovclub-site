**Georgism**

By James Tyrwhitt-Drake

Georgism, itâ€™s the most elegant economic policy with the clunkiest possible name. What is it? Also known as the â€˜Single Land Value Taxâ€™, it is a proposal to completely rework our economy with a simple tweak: replace sales and income taxes with taxes on land (broadly defined to include both actual land and the natural commons). Why do this? It is claimed it would reduce income inequality, increase economic efficiency, prevent land speculation, allow workers to keep the value of their labour, distribute the benefits of public investment fairly, and promote efficient land use and development. In short, Georgism presents a solution to the tragedy of the commons that is implemented through market mechanisms. We will discuss the history of Georgism, the mechanisms and plausibility of its claims, and its possible future.
