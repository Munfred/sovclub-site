*We the people of the Sovereignty Club, in order to form a more perfect club, establish legitimacy, insure fun discussions, provide for refreshments, promote a general good time, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, did ordain and successfully navigate the Caltech Westphallian interclub system in obtaining recognition amongst our peers and establishing establishing the Caltech Sovereignty club.*



**That's right, fellow aspiring sovereigns. The Caltech Sovereignty Club is now officially recognized within the Wesphalian club order, and we even got $200 from the GSC.** I know you all have been eagerly holding your breathes since you signed up for the club several months ago, but as you know diplomacy, due procedure, and such takes time.



**What matters is that the Sovereignty Club is now officially legit and we'll be at the club fair tomorrow on olive walk 4:30-7pm recruiting more followers.**

We will be decorating our table with flags of non countries, so if you have a suggestion you'd like to see let us know! Wether extinct or non represented nations, basically any flag that's not a member of the UN is acceptable! Except for Taiwan.\
If you want ideas for old school flags, take a look here: [https://commons.â€‹wikimedia.org/wiki/Flags\_of\_â€‹extinct_states](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_extinct_states). But if you're interested in contemporary ones, take a look here: [http://www.unpo.org/â€‹members.php](http://www.unpo.org/members.php)



**Also, our first meeting will be next wednesday, October 17, at 6pm on the Neurotechers lougner, BBB B101.** We'll go over introductions, current events, and discuss this short article from Aeon about countries ([https://aeon.co/essays/the-â€‹end-of-a-world-of-nation-â€‹states-may-be-upon-us](https://aeon.co/essays/the-end-of-a-world-of-nation-states-may-be-upon-us)). Will be cool if you get a chance to read it.



**Finally, I am happy to announce that we now have the [official](http://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/) ![ðŸš©](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f6a9)****[Sovereignty Forums](http://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/).**

That's right. Not only we have a wonderful website at [https://caltechsovereignty.â€‹club/](https://caltechsovereignty.club/), we now have an \*independent\*, \*ad free\*, \*100% organic\*, \*fair trade\*,\*non-GMO\* and \*ethically sourced\* forum at [http://forum.â€‹caltechsovereignty.club/](http://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/). If you sign up for the forum, it's configured by default to send an email with new posts and comments as they happen, and you can reply directly from your email so that you don't even need to use the actual forum to participate in discussions. **So if you want to stay abreast of Sovereignty Club activities, you should [sign up for the](http://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/) ![ðŸš©](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f6a9)****[Sovereignty Forums.](http://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/)** You can choose the frequency of the digests, and I hope to use the ![ðŸš©](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f6a9) Sovereignty Forums to conduct club business going forward.
