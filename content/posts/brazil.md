It is a truth universally acknowledged that shitty countries spawn shitty countries.



Tomorrow, we grapple with this truth. We grapple with Brazil. But don't take it from me. Take it from this [rap song](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13TB3xXwxOoz2uIB0yCo5axXXbikyEt0n7DIbT9qHkR0/edit?usp=sharing), [Darwin](https://books.google.com/books?id=8GYVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=The+Brazilians,+as+far+as+I+am+able+to+judge,+possess+but+a+small+share+of+those+qualities+which+give+dignity+to+mankind.+Ignorant,+cowardly,+%26amp;+indolent+in+the+extreme;+hospitable+%26+good+natured+as+long+as+it+gives+them+no+trouble;+temperate,+revengeful,+but+not+quarrelsome;+contented+with+themselves+%26+their+customs,+they+answer+all+remarks+by+asking+%22why+cannot+we+do+as+our+grandfathers+before+us+did%22.+%E2%80%94+Their+very+appearance+bespeaks+their+little+elevation+of+character.+%E2%80%94+figures+short,+they+soon+become+corpulent;+and+their+faces+possessing+little+expression,+appear+sunk+between+the+shoulders.+%E2%80%94+The+Monks+differ+for+the+worse+in+this+latter+respect;+it+requires+little+physiognomy+to+see+plainly+stamped+persevering+cunning,+sensuality+%26+pride.+%E2%80%94+One+old+man+I+always+stop+to+look+at,+the+only+thing+I+ever+saw+like+it,+is+Scoens+Judas+Iscariot.&source=bl&ots=rcf8aB1smA&sig=ACfU3U1LtNxKkEgbMUyLnuUBq7OaFi2LgA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjhnbqM6f_nAhWEtp4KHblOB0MQ6AEwAnoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Brazilians%2C%20as%20far%20as%20I%20am%20able%20to%20judge%2C%20possess%20but%20a%20small%20share%20of%20those%20qualities%20which%20give%20dignity%20to%20mankind.%20Ignorant%2C%20cowardly%2C%20%26amp%3B%20indolent%20in%20the%20extreme%3B%20hospitable%20%26%20good%20natured%20as%20long%20as%20it%20gives%20them%20no%20trouble%3B%20temperate%2C%20revengeful%2C%20but%20not%20quarrelsome%3B%20contented%20with%20themselves%20%26%20their%20customs%2C%20they%20answer%20all%20remarks%20by%20asking%20%22why%20cannot%20we%20do%20as%20our%20grandfathers%20before%20us%20did%22.%20%E2%80%94%20Their%20very%20appearance%20bespeaks%20their%20little%20elevation%20of%20character.%20%E2%80%94%20figures%20short%2C%20they%20soon%20become%20corpulent%3B%20and%20their%20faces%20possessing%20little%20expression%2C%20appear%20sunk%20between%20the%20shoulders.%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Monks%20differ%20for%20the%20worse%20in%20this%20latter%20respect%3B%20it%20requires%20little%20physiognomy%20to%20see%20plainly%20stamped%20persevering%20cunning%2C%20sensuality%20%26%20pride.%20%E2%80%94%20One%20old%20man%20I%20always%20stop%20to%20look%20at%2C%20the%20only%20thing%20I%20ever%20saw%20like%20it%2C%20is%20Scoens%20Judas%20Iscariot.&f=false), or [sovbot](https://pastebin.com/raw/Y5JGiH9k).



Now, if you don't know a lot about Brazil, [this letter](https://markmanson.net/brazil), which was \*not written by me\* should tell you all you need to know. If you do know a lot about Brazil, I just want to remind you that the limit is \_two\_ vegetables per person.



And if you'd like to test your knowledge about Brazil, feel free to take the [Brazil test](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lNonFSMCZL-LhJ1VQpy1_uHGsbPl5YuEsxtjshO3xqY/edit?usp=sharing). Answers at the end. Don't cheat.



Tomorrow's discussion shall begin with a review of the history of Brazil, followed by pictures of my recent investigative trip down there to make sure everything was as I remember and nothing changed. I can assure you that nothing has changed. Not in the past year, decade, or century.



See you tomorrow 6PM at Sovereignty Lounge, BBB B101.



In sovereignty,



Eduardo
