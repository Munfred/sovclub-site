Today, we'll have a special session of Sovereignty Club.  Our founder Eduardo Beltrame is coming back to visit, bringing us food, drinks, and alcohol.  He'll be running the meeting, just like old times. 

Also, our mentor, Caltech Professor of Social Science Tracy Dennison, is coming in person. She'll tell us about her new research project on rule of law and early state formation, based on the case studies of early modern Russia and Prussia.  What are strong and weak states, why do they matter, and why did strong states develop in western Europe and not eastern Europe or most places outside Europe?
