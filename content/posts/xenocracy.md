It is a truth universally acknowledged that democracies have a bunch of problems, and so do autocracies. At their worst, democracies succumb to populist demagogues who pretend to care for the people while in truth delivering nothing, or who will readily drag the country into war and clashing with the international order (see Europe 1930s). At their worst, autocracies do the same (ibid.).



But what alternative is there? Tonight we will talk about a little known system of government called xenocracy, which aims to fix the flaws of democracy while eliminating altogether the risk of international hullabaloo and total war brought about by some autocracies. Sounds too good to be true? Read on.



In a xenocratic system, the rulers of a polity are not chosen by the members of that polity. Rather, they are chosen by the leaders of neighboring polities (representative xenocracy), or by all the people of neighboring polities (popular xenocracy). When the people from other polities are directly in charge of voting for laws and propositions, it is called direct xenocracy. Some recent variations include ranked choice voting and weighted vote by inverse distance of polity center of government.



If this sounds crazy, it is only because you haven't read about [other things people tried](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism).



Think about it.



The problem with democracy (and most other things in life) is that people can't make good choices for themselves.



When you can't agree with other people, what do you do? Take a vote? Bigger group wins? No. You pick a [random schmuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration) (if it's a small deal), or a [bunch of random schmucks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury) (if it's a big deal) and *\*they\** vote on it. Why? Because you can't trust people to do what is right when they themselves are concerned! It is genuinely befuddling that people thought letting people choose *\*their\** government could end well.



Tonight we will explore the different ways that xenocratic systems could be structured and discuss anecdotal evidence that this is a good idea. There will be slides.
