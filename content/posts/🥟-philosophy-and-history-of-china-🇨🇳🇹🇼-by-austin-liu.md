Last time in ourÂ ChinaÂ series we looked at the ancient history ofÂ China, starting with the how the Jade Emperor became the ruler of all the other gods and immortals.Â 

Wait, no, we didn't do that. We instead looked at the pre-imperial history ofÂ China, discussing its geography, philosophy, and some features of the state of Qin that led to it #winning.Â 

However, the 9th day of the Lunar New Year is traditionally the Jade Emperor's birthday. On this auspicious day we willÂ 

1. Revisit some influential philosophies that have spread across the empire andÂ 
2. Look atÂ China's "classical period" - the Qin and Han dynasties that begin 2000 years of imperial rule.Â 
3. Eat dumplings again (if you come to my place)
