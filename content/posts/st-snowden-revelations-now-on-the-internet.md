No, still no sovclub this week. I'm in Europe conducting an investigative journalism trip to uncover the truth about the Nordic countries (spoiler: it's all true).



BUT! As I muster the will to finish this glass of Tuborg (it's a relative of Carlsberg, of which I've had a German sized glass already, together with two shots of tequila INVOLUNTARILY handed to me - no such thing as squearming about peer pressure here in the land of the free, you just down it) and conjure superhuman powers not to make any typos (nonstandard english words and usage don't count at typos) I must seize the moment (since it's still pre-sovclub Wednesday in America) to inform you about a happening of utmost importance:





Sovereignty Club Edgelord Patron Saint Edward Snowden book of revelations was published yesterday, and is since t=0 available on libgen:

I should mention that such content is to be consumed without guilt, for the US government, in order to hasten the canonization of St. Snowden, just sued him and his publishers to keep any proceedings from the book:

You know how the saying goes. Better to download from the internet than to give money to the government!

PS: I should add that uncle Sam is probably right on this \_particular\_ instance, for St Snowden signed this agreement (lol dude look at his handwriting) <https://web.archive.org/web/20191220112225/https://arstechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-1.pdf>[](https://arstechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-1.pdf), which said in clause 12 that America gets to keep all proceeds and emoluments from divulging anything covered by the NDA without authorization.
