**Above:**Â the image Jason AllenÂ [recently used to lit a fire under the art world](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=c82a5ee181&e=09f1ce99cf). He used AI image generators to create it, submitted it to the State Fair fine arts competition under the digital arts category, and took first prize.





This week our very own James shared [two](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=f0eff114e9&e=09f1ce99cf) [articles](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=9e774ca8d9&e=09f1ce99cf) on AI image and audio generators, with several hot takes on how these tools quickly going mainstream will affect society, and then spared me the trouble of writing an email:

* The threshold to create fake/harmful/misleading content is dramatically lowered, where previously you needed to pay or be an artist to make imaginary content, and more realistic = more expensive.
* Most people accept (and will continue to) images and video at face value, and this will make politics and misinformation super weird and intense.
* Semiotic hazard: the meaningfulness of art and images in general is greatly reduced, and human culture is subject to attractors and feedback loops in the AI space.
* Replaces the part of art-making the cultivates human beings. The process of intentionality, skill, and discovery cultured in the person making the art is bypassed, and art is only about the result. Crafting a prompt doesn't help you see a region or a person the way painting a landscape or a portrait does.
* The livelihood of millions of artists is degraded. An artist who develops a skill they are passionate about and does commercial work (making logos, for example) on the side, is now redundant, and cannot afford to practice their craft.

I think Jason Allen makes some really good points about what this means for art and artists, and his means of pulling this stunt seem reasonable. He did also put a lot of work into it, and creating a category for AI art seems like a good solution for art competitions.

That said, we need to be asking some deep questions about what art is and what it does to people. The action of creating this artwork in midjourney transforms the artist in a much different way than it would if he created it without AI, and I think the quality of the latter is important to the world. We transform ourselves through the artmaking process and that process gives our society and culture important properties. In my opinion that action, of bringing the world into ourselves through our senses and expressing it through art is one of the ultimate purposes of being human, and should be a goal the society is designed to cultivate.

**But who is James?**

James Tyrwhitt-Drake combines science and art to facilitate experiences of the beauty of the universe. He works to make inaccessible and invisible phenomena of the cosmos directly available to human senses, allowing people to experience a connection to the universe with intellect, emotion, and sensation. This process helps people make themselves out of the universe by recreating it inside their minds. His two lines of work involve making physical models of the micro and macro worlds; creating 3D printed molecules and topographic maps, respectively.
