What are nation states? Where do they come from? Where are they going to?

This week on Sovereignty Club we're getting around to finally discussing this article from Aeon about nation-states and city-states: [https://aeon.co/essays/the-â€‹end-of-a-world-of-nation-â€‹states-may-be-upon-us](https://aeon.co/essays/the-end-of-a-world-of-nation-states-may-be-upon-us)

We'll be meeting this **Wednesday, November 14 at 6pm** on [Sovereignty Lounge](https://i.imgur.com/zQNZHyv.jpg), BBB B101 to discuss.



I should note that the author of the article has written a(n) (appropriately titled) book called [Radicals Chasing Utopia](https://www.amazon.com/Radicals-Chasing-Utopia-Inside-Movements/dp/1568589867), which I ended up reading since I liked the article. In the book he basically devotes one chapter to a group doing wonky stuff: psichedelics peole, enviromentalist groups, hippie communes, right wing European movements, the five start movement in Italy, the transumanist crowd in the US and the crazy libertarians trying to make [Liberland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberland) a reality. If you haven't heard of Liberland I strongly encourage you to read a bit on it, since it's directly related to this week's topic.



See you tomorrow



Eduardo



PS: We're having some disruptions with the website right now because I forgot to renew the domain, but if the gods of the internet are fair and the intertube waves are speedy it should soon resolve itself. I hope.
