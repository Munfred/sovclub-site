Are you tired of being trapped in the Heat Dome?  Well do we have news for you! 🔴Welcome to the HEAT SPHERE🔴!!! Also known as the climate globe🌡️ 🌏. It's the ultimate evolutionary combat venue. 🏟️  Billions of participants trapped inside in a PUBG style Battle Royale. ⚔️🛡️  As time passes it gets hotter and hotter. 📈  The habitable land area shrinks as the oceans rise! 🏊  Only the best nations will survive. 🏴‍☠️

Join us today to peer into the near and far future of the global climate. 🔮🌏  We'll be discussing the most serious aspects of climate change, including comparisons to recent historical climate change, details of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), the primary, secondary, and tertiary effects of global heating, the effects of migration on nations, positive climate feedback loops, climate simulations and informed speculation on the course of history over the next 1000 years. 📅  And most excitingly, we'll be looking at what happens if we completely melt my favourite continent, Antarctica! 🇦🇶

Join us tonight at 18:00 Pacific time, <https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668>

In sovereignty,
