*How to effectively reconcile capitalism with **low marginal cost public goods?*** 

\
Capitalism/market economy as we tend to picture it is a remarkably effective set of rules for getting people to cooperate and be productive when it comes to dealing with scarce goods, where the marginal cost of making an extra one is not negligible.

 \
However, I think that it doesn’t work nearly as well with where the cost of making an extra one is negligible after a given initial investment - negligible marginal cost goods (NMCG).  That’s because NMCG are best used if they are turned into public goods, made available for free/very low so that people are not excluded from consuming them due to price. The exception is if the initial cost of the good (C) is high and the number of people who can consume (N) it is low, then the NMCG should be sold for C/N to be viable. But let’s restrict our thinking to NMCG where C/N is small. Many such NMCG that I can think of consist of data of some kind, mainly because for data (and information services generally) the potential N is everyone, while for physical public goods N is smaller, and unlike physical things data has very little constraints on dissemination and consumption. Examples are art, software, ideas, discoveries. 



Not all NMCG are *turned into* [public goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-good.asp) and, and not all public goods are NMCG, but there's a big overlap, because the definition of **public goods** is that they are **non-rivalrous** (goods do not dwindle in supply as more people consume them) and **non-excludable** (the good is available to all citizens). Perhaps the true definition of public goods is that in reality they are all* **“quasi-public”** goods because, although they are made available to all, their value can diminish as more people use them*. Like roads and congestion, or treating the environment as dumping ground for pollution. Gradually but surely you destroy the good through excessive consumption. By definition, that should not be possible with NMCG.

 \
So if NMCG should ideally be given away for free, how do we pay for the cost of creating them? That is the fundamental question that has spawned [endless threads on Hacker News](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&query=open%20source%20funding&sort=byPopularity&type=story). I’m confident that eventually [new game theoretic solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421) [implemented on smart contracts running on Ethereum](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) will provide an incredible way of doing it that I never thought of. But I’d like something that I can use now. After much thinking, I realized a tried and true solution has been staring us in the face for a long time: *endowments*.

 \
For example, universities producing public goods that have been around for hundreds of years have a common denominator in that they all have endowments. That enabled them to do untold good for the world (I’m a big fan of universities) by training and funding people who go on to make things like art, software, ideas, discoveries.  

\
So in an idealized world the endowments could be invested in companies whose revenue model revolves around scarce goods, and the proceeds of the endowments are plowed back into production of NMCG which are released as public goods.

\
How to decide how to allocate the endowments proceeds is something that I’m not sure about. The value production dynamics of “knowledge workers” tends to be quite different from other occupations where physical labour is required (how many hours are spent working on a thing correlate well with generated value) because so much of the “work” is actually background processing of an idea or problem in your head, and taking longer to deliver a result (sometimes just letting time pass while having it on the back of your mind!) can yield disproportionately more value. The best solution that I have (probably better for academic settings than product producing settings): get a bunch of smart people motivated not by the money, but by the work environment and problems they need to work on. Pay them handsomely, give them plenty of resources, general but clear directions on what to achieve, and let them figure out how to go about achieving it.

\
I once pitched a refinement of this idea to Valentine in order to evaluate the value of e.g. each repository on GitHub, use something like Page Rank on the adjacency matrix of the stars in the repositories. That could be done for any system where users have unique identities and can give a rating to goods produced by other users. So for example it could also work on good reads reviews. Then we do that for every possible kind of good and we solve capitalism.\
After I pitched this to Valentine, he said: “You’re describing Whuffies.” “What?” “Whuffies. There’s a book where this happened and the Page Rank points are called Whuffies. It’s called [Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_and_Out_in_the_Magic_Kingdom), you should read it.”. So I did. Great book, by Cory Doctorow.
