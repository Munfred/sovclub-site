I wasn't planning on doing anything, but then I was informed that tonights debate [WILL HAVE A MUTE BUTTON](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54635713). Here's all you need to know:

> O*nce Mr Biden begins to speak, Mr Trump's audio feed will be cut. This will not be done by the moderator, though. Instead, a member of the production crew who works for the Commission on Presidential Debates will be responsible for turning off Trump's microphone.*



I'm wondering if that will work. Maybe they'll just scream so loud the others microphone will catch it. We will see!\
