*"Augustus won over the soldiers with gifts, the populace with cheap corn, and all men with the sweets of repose, and so grew greater by degrees, while he concentrated in himself the functions of the Senate, the magistrates, and the laws. He was wholly unopposed, for the boldest spirits had fallen in battle, or in the proscription, while the remaining nobles, the readier they were to be slaves, were raised the higher by wealth and promotion, so that, aggrandised by revolution, they preferred the safety of the present to the dangerous past. Nor did the provinces dislike that condition of affairs, for they distrusted the government of the Senate and the people, because of the rivalries between the leading men and the rapacity of the officials, while the protection of the laws was unavailing, as they were continually deranged by violence, intrigue, and finally by corruption." -- Livy, History of Rome*



In the past 4 weeks, I narrated the collapse of the Roman Republic. Today, I'll summarize the collapse in lightning speed, then talk a bit about the Augustan autocracy that replaced the Republic. Finally, I'll talk about why the Republic collapsed in the first place. Was it the decline of morals brought about by the decadent East--as many Romans believed--or are there other forces at work? What lessons can we learn from the past?
