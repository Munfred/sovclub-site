Around 500 AD, the region that is now Ethiopia was home to [a kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum "https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum") that became rich and powerful through exporting frankincense and myrrh, which found buyers from Spain to China.¬†¬†Andy, the host of the [History of Africa Podcast](https://historyofafricapodcast.blogspot.com/ "https\://historyofafricapodcast.blogspot.com/"), will join us to discuss his recently concluded season on Aksum. Topics include the history of this great empire, its military, economy, and religion (it was either the 1st or 2nd Christian state in the world!), as well as Aksum's impact on the greater history of the human race. Finally, we will conclude with some speculation about why, despite this great empire's notoriety, it is so obscure compared to its contemporaries like Rome and the Sassanids.
