**TLDR** (as I *know* you never do)**:** Tomorrow 6PM at BBB B101 we will be joined by [Open Tech Club](https://www.opentechnology.club/) to discuss the regulation of technology, in the backdrop of [four tech regulation bills currently making the rounds in the US senate](https://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/t/ongoing-2019-us-tech-bills/148). Please join us for *Regulate-a-tech, the game‚Ñ¢* : tell us everything they did wrong, and how YOU would do better. If you can convince more than half of the attendance, we'll pass your amendment.

The way that new laws and regulations (traditionally) come about (in America especially) is:

> i) In the beginning, everyone is free to do anything in a certain domain\
> ii) Bad things happen because of something people did in that domain\
> iii) People get mad\
> iv) Bad things continue to happen\
> v) Eventually a bad enough thing happens, or enough bad things happen, that the government steps in specifies what people can do in that domain, and how.\
> vi) Go back to (i) and iterate for ever finer sub-domains\
> vii) As t‚Üí‚àû , or until the government collapses or the sun explodes, there‚Äôs eventually so much accumulated regulation that you can‚Äôt do anything anymore, since most laws, like diamonds, taxes, death and the blockchain, are forever.

Eventually people get used to them and just consider it to be a fact of life. For example, did you know what:

* Prior to 1906 [Pure Food and Drug Act](https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/food-and-drug-act-1906), the labeling and sale of food and especially drugs were virtually unregulated, leading to abundant shady practices and general misleading of consumers. Together with a series of extensions and other laws, this lead to the creation of the [Food and Drug Administration and 1927](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration).
* [Jaywalking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaywalking) only [became a crime](https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history) after cars became abundant and people started getting run over.

In more recent times, the pattern continues. The trigger for a new wave of regulations is often a new technology that enables new ways to do bad things. For example:

* Model airplanes, gas balloons and other ‚Äúdrones‚Äù have been around for over a century, but it was only when quad-copters became immensely popular, less than 10 years ago, that the [FAA got tough and heavily regulated their use](https://www.dartdrones.com/blog/drone-laws/)
* Money, banks, stocks and financial things have been regulated since the dawn of time, and get regulated again [every time they lead to a new crisis](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2010/11/20/the-financial-panic-of-2008-and-financial-regulatory-reform/). A few years ago people realized that appending the words ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù and ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù to their financial instruments was an excellent excuse to ignore regulations. After a sufficient amount of fraud and scams, the regulators stepped in, fined a bunch of people, and [issued guidelines for using the word blockchain](https://www.coindesk.com/the-sec-just-released-its-crypto-token-guidance).
* Back when the cyberspace was invented, you could do anything. Then [hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act), [spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003), and [evil corporations spying on you and being evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica) [happened](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/07/ftcs-5-billion-facebook-settlement-record-breaking-history), and they were all regulated. Most notable is the [European General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) dictating how companies should deal with personal data, but this is a fad everywhere. For example, the [California Consumer Privacy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act) deals with many of the same issues, and there‚Äôs even a [new law about bots](https://www.wired.com/story/law-makes-bots-identify-themselves/#targetText=On%20July%201%2C%20nine%20months,behaviors%20to%20conspicuously%20declare%20themselves.). Stay tuned for the next chapters worldwide.
* For billions of years, nobody cared about how natural selection, [transposons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element) and [horizontal gene transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer#targetText=Horizontal%20gene%20transfer%20(HGT)%20or,the%20evolution%20of%20many%20organisms.) affected the DNA of living things. It was only when humans started doing much of the same things with new tools that people got worried about genetically modified [crops](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_crops#targetText=Genetically%20modified%20crops%20(GM%20crops,occur%20naturally%20in%20the%20species.>), [mosquitoes](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/gm-mosquito-progeny-not-dying-in-brazil--study-66434), and [crispier babies](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00673-1) (albeit KFC is looking into crispier chickens).

But! Not all laws about technology are about trying to keep terrible things from happening! Every now and again, governments try to encourage good deeds with technology! This can be done not only by directly leveraging technology to improve government services, but also by clarifying or creating a regulatory framework so that potential good faith entrepreneurs are not afraid of getting smacked by the government for moving fast and breaking things. For example:

* The government of Singapore developed a [blockchain based platform for issuing and validating academic certificates](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/with-this-blockchain-based-platform-you-may-no-longer-need-physical-certificates).
* The California government has passed bills [defining blockchain technology and allowing companies to use it for corporate records.](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=562a6c07-0230-4362-bd30-8cd2ce5dae61)
* The government of Estonia [offers almost all of it‚Äôs‚Äô services online](https://www.raconteur.net/technology/estonia-digital-society), including voting.

**Things are happening in America**



Now! The government of the United States of America got rattled up by an [instance of commonplace data shenanigans that received particularly sustained media coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal). In its wake, politicians across the board were left convinced that *something* had to be done, even if they had no clue what, since the overwhelming majority has a law/policy/business/education background. See pages [3-5 of this report](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45583.pdf), it is quite enlightening. Did you know that only 21/435 representatives and 4/100 senators have a"doctoral degree or so", and almost all of them are medical degrees? The list of [US politicians with a research doctorate is surprisingly sparse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_politicians_with_doctorates).



Anyhow, surprisingly *someone* did come around and proposed something. Last year [this US senator guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Warner) (or most likely someone in his office) wrote a [whitepaper/poorly formatted college essay](https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/d/3/d32c2f17-cc76-4e11-8aa9-897eb3c90d16/65A7C5D983F899DAAE5AA21F57BAD944.social-media-regulation-proposals.pdf) outlining 20 points for possible tech regulation. Even more surprisingly, since then [no less than FOUR bills](https://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/t/ongoing-2019-us-tech-bills/148) have been proposed dealing with some of the topics, which I have boldened below.

1. Duty to clearly and conspicuously label bots
2. Duty to determine the origin of posts and/or accounts
3. Duty to identify inauthentic accounts
4. Make platforms liable for state-law torts (defamation, false light, public disclosure of private facts) for failure to take down deep fake or other manipulated audio/video content
5. **Public Interest Data Access Bill**
6. Require Interagency Task Force for Countering Asymmetric Threats to Democratic Institutions
7. Disclosure Requirements for Online Political Advertisements
8. Public Initiative for Media Literacy
9. Increasing Deterrence Against Foreign Manipulation
10. **Information fiduciary**
11. **Privacy rulemaking authority at FTC**
12. Comprehensive (GDPR-like) data protection legislation
13. **1st Party Consent for Data Collection**
14. **Statutory determination that so-called ‚Äòdark patterns‚Äô are unfair and deceptive trade practices**
15. Algorithmic auditability/fairness
16. **Data Transparency Bill**
17. **Data Portability Bill**
18. **Interoperability**
19. Opening federal datasets to university researchers and qualified small businesses/startups
20. Essential Facilities Determinations

A [summary of each bill is available at the Sovereignty Forums](https://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/t/ongoing-2019-us-tech-bills/148), but for your convenience I make available below the one line summary and a link to the original bill text. They are actually surprisingly short and easy to read, I suggest you take a look!



[S.2658 - ACCESS Act of 2019](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2658/text) - Introduced 2019-10-22: *A bill to promote competition and reduce consumer switching costs in the provision of online communications services.*



[S.1951 - DASHBOARD act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1951/%20text) - Introduced 2019-06-25: *To require the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate regulations relating to the disclosure of certain commercial data, and for other purposes.*



[S.1578 - Do Not Track Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1578/text) - Introduced 2019-05-21: *To protect the privacy of internet users through the establishment of a national Do Not Track system, and for other purposes.*\
\
[S.1084 - DETOUR Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1084/text) - Introduced 2019-04-09: *To prohibit the usage of exploitative and deceptive practices by large online operators and to promote consumer welfare in the use of behavioral research by such providers.*

As you know, when America does a thing, the free world follow. And given the nature of the cyberspace, the impact of these bills is likely to be global and immediate. So what they say, and *how* they say it matters even (especially?) if all you care about is living in your mother's basement surfing the internet. Think about it, and come tell us how you'd do better. Maybe, *just maybe*, it could make a difference. See you at BBB B101, tomorrow at 6PM! Cheers Eduardo



PS: Remember that time when we went to the [NoHo-Pasadena Bus Rapid Transit](https://www.metro.net/projects/noho-pasadena-corridor/) meeting and we heard Michael say sensible things about Chinese food and Dylan (literally) talk about cosmic alignment of the route to a packed house? Valentine has finally gotten around to processing the pictures he took back then, and I put them on the [Sovereignty forum thread here](https://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/t/july-7-field-trip-to-the-brt-scoping-meeting/120).\

PSS: Given that this is a special meeting, bullshit time might be reduced. In order to spare you and everyone else, here's what I have to say this week: Argentina has fallen. [To populism](https://www.thenation.com/article/argentina-fernandez-kirchner-peronismo/). Again. I'm crying for you Argentina.
