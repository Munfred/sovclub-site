💬💩⛪👨‍🏫🤢🦹🏿

Hi Y'all,

At tonight’'s is BYOB, Brener has some bullshit he would like to discuss.

First regarding people he is inviting to talk with us: He got Mark Lutter to come tell us about Braavos, his new venture, next week. He also contacted other folks such as Viktor Gushan, the transnistrian Billionaire.

Lastly, but not least, Brener visited Stanford and was moved by the beauty of the original campus and ugliness surrounding it. Brener things the empire is intentionally evil and it is terribly sick (shots fired, Dylan). He will very likely talk about it too.

So, BYOB as so we have more topics to discuss.
