Michael: I'm in Germany right now, so I thought I'd try a crazy idea: a meet-and-greet for new members.  If you've attended less than 2 meetings before November 2021 (even if you've been on the mailing list forever), you're welcome to gather at the north entrance of the Behavioral Biology Lab Wednesday at 6 pm (location marked on map) to meet other new members.  You could talk, go to a coffee shop, or eat dinner at a restaurant, so long as you do it together.  Up to $200 will be reimbursed by the club, with a maximum of $15 per person.  Don't remember whether you've attended more than 2 meetings before November 2021?  I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

Eduardo: And to all of our old timers (and people that cannot make it in person): feel free to come hangout at our zoom <https://caltech.zoom.us/my/sovcall>
