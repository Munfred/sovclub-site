The Sovereignty Club official unofficial Space Council™*,



Considering that humans are a bunch of neurotic, paranoid, sex-crazed naked apes engaged in mostly time consuming made-up games devoid of higher purpose;



Observing that the survival of our species and civilization relies solely on our ability to maintain the conditions of life in an egg shaped rock floating around in a sea of quantum energy fluctuations mostly devoid of mass; 



Understanding that as a group of apes what really makes some sense is to conquer outer worlds and establish colonies that might outlive our homeworld and given time, evolve into something else;



Emphasizing that thousands of years of scientific development and capital accumulation now allows private enterprises to take on the challenge of space exploration and play a major role in space colonization,



1. Calls upon the Club to discuss opportunities in the private space race, namely:

1. the main challenges and opportunities not addressed, either at all or to satisfaction, by the main players;
2. pains the main players will suffer once attempts of moving humans elsewhere take place;
3. how the aforementioned pains can be solved;
4. which problems are worth sorting out;

2. Encourages attendees to consider the following references: 

1. [The 12 Greatest Challenges for Space Exploration](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/space-is-cold-vast-and-deadly-humans-will-explore-it-anyway/) - Wired;
2. [Investing in space](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space%5C)  - Morgan Stanley;
3. [Space Technology Grand Challenges Topics](https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/503466main_space_tech_grand_challenges_12_02_10.pdf) - NASA;



3. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.



In Sovereignty,



Brener & Eduardo
