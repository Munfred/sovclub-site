This weekend we watched the 2019 banana Netflix production [The Edge of Democracy](https://www.netflix.com/title/80190535). By the end of it, everyone was very confused, due to i) everything in Bananaland being, in fact, a mess; and ii) it not being really targeted to an international audience.



To further entrench what is now just mild bewilderment, tonight we in the third episode of our Banana series we will be talking about POLITICS! So brace yourselves and buckle up, because it will be a wild ride.

See you at 6 pm cartime: [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)

PS: By the end of tonight you'll probably certainly still be left asking *[What (the fuck) happened to Brazil?](https://www.bbc.com/reel/playlist/what-happened-to-brazil)* To remedy that, this Saturday 5pm cartime we will be watching the eponymous documentary, made by the #Bestempire Broadcasting Corporation, for an international audience. If that doesn't help, nothing will. Don't worry, you'll be in good company.\

PSS: In a very timely manner, the current issue of Foreign Affairs published an article titled (roughly) *[Messiah Complex: How Bananaland Made Trumponaro](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/brazil/2020-08-11/jair-bolsonaro-messiah-complex)*. It's written by [this guy](https://brianbwinter.com/), who looks cool and wrote a couple [enticingly titled books](https://brianbwinter.com/critical-praise/).
