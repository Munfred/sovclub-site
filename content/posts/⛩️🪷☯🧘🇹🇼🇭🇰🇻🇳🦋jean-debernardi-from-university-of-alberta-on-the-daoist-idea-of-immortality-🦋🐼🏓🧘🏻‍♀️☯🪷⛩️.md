**Daoist idea of immortality**

\
Jean plans to discuss the Daoist idea of immortality and will start by discussing a famous passage in the writings of the early Chinese philosophy[ Zhuangzi](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=1040761317&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!9gsGznZpw4DHpRORGWCoBdcgM2K5jSmEeTl1KzyWtthPO7JQlZeD20K06XlHSi46Nk8dCHhizsh8FNOABCNvLN9nn4br5g$) - She was kind to share this suggested reading - She is going to contrast the philosophical interpretation of the story of Zhuangzi and the dream with the religious interpretation, including looking at the Daoist quest for immortality and spiritual experiences. She also intend to comment on the modern use of stories--including the story of Zhuangzi's dream-- in the modern practice of temple oracle divination, which is a way that Chinese mythology comes into play in people's everyday lives.
