Tonight we'll be watching the 2007 brazilian film [Elite Squad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Squad), which back then teenage me thought was the best brazilian movie ever - an opinion I still hold, with the possible exception of the 2010 follow up [Elite Squad 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Squad:_The_Enemy_Within).



See you at 5pm cartime at [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)
