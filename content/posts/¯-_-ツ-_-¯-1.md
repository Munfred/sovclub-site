Tonight we'll be meeting at the usual time at the usual link:



Because of reasons I didn't get around to preparing a topic. I heard Austin wanted to tell us about Otto Von Bismarck. [Here's a 20 min video about Otto](https://youtu.be/LFtz5ZTJxxw).[](https://youtu.be/LFtz5ZTJxxw)





On other news, at the next sovwatch we will be watching [Backstabbing for Beginners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstabbing_for_Beginners), a movie based on the whistle-blower book by the same name that tells the story of the UN's biggest corruption scandal even: the Oil for Food program. It seems to be available on [amazon prime](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.f0b17272-647a-e950-788d-37ae3e5d9061?camp=1789&creativeASIN=B07CJLYPZ9&ie=UTF8&linkCode=xm2&tag=justwatch09-20)

See you tonight



Eduardo
