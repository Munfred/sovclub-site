Self-referentiality has been the bane of ubernerds (read: mathematicians, philosophers and everyone who watched inception) everywhere for… as long as they’ve been alive. To see this more clearly, let us flip through the biography of a fictional median mathematician/philosopher:



Age 6 - Learns about the [Liar’s paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox) from a TV show or something, and is fascinated by it. Thinking he must be a genius because he understands it, he poses it as a riddle to anyone who will listen for several weeks straight. In the process, he manages to stump every kid and even some adults, and, unbeknownst to him, convinces everyone who meets him, young and old, that he is an unbearable, pedantic pain in the ass. His academic future is now assured.



Age 15 - Spends the entire summer in his room enthralled by [Godel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach), which is fine with everyone else, since they weren’t going to invite him out anyway. Not after that annoying liar’s paradox bullshit he pulled in first grade. Unfortunately for everyone else, they haven’t read Godel, Escher, Bach, which means they’re going to get a 1:1 scale replica of the audiobook forcibly inserted into their ear canals the next time they run into our protagonist. His teenage virginity is now secured.



Age 20-30 - After entering college (followed by a second bachelor’s, followed by a lengthy PhD) and deciding that socializing is a waste of time, our special nerd starts to truly delve into the philosophical notion of self-reference. In the depths of the library, he struggles with an only partially comprehensible world: [Bam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems)! [Zing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica)! [Wowee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem)! Certainty becomes a thing of the past, as does hygiene.



Age 40ish - All of his mathematics/philosophy colleagues from his school days have long ago abandoned the quest for certain uncertainty. They’ve moved on to hedge funds, becoming extremely wealthy and marrying women with fake breasts and butts who are indifferent whether they live or die (perhaps slightly preferring death, given the life insurance payouts). Gazing at his naturally-endowed wife who actually loves him despite his complete absence of social skills, our hero grows transiently jealous. Pondering his quiet teaching job at Wherever University, our hero grows indignant. All this jealousy, despite the fact that later philosophers will regard his escape from bachelorhood with any living female whomsoever as the clearest epistemological evidence yet for the existence of miracles. All this indignity, despite the fact that he can’t lecture to save his fucking life and just blames it on his students’ poor cognitive skills.



Yes, at some point in life, every ubernerd reaches the point where he knows he’s the smartest person on Earth and knows that’s what everyone likes and about him and can’t understand why he isn’t treated accordingly by the world at large. At that point in life, he naturally seeks out a community for people who think they’re the smartest person on Earth...



And that’s when he resolves to finally show up to sovcall at 6pm on Wednesday, because they’ll be discussing [reflexivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory)) and, those philistines, they’ll be using [George Soros](https://www.georgesoros.com/2014/01/13/fallibility-reflexivity-and-the-human-uncertainty-principle-2/) and some other [rando schmuck from the internet](https://danco.substack.com/p/rwhitehousebets) as their primary source for the discussion. How… quaint.



In Sovereignty,
