How can one city be all of those things?Â  Come find out!Â  We'll discuss the education, ideology, selection of rulers, military strategy, role of women, family life (or lack thereof), and censorship in Plato's Kallipolis.Â Â We'll also discuss the nature of justice, the origin of metaphysical reality, and the three-part soul.



I'm attaching a good modern translation of Plato's Republic (by Reeve), in case anyone's interested in reading it.Â  If you don't want to read it, I attached the very comprehensive notes I made while reading it.Â  If you don't want to read that either, you can read the 18-page Introduction in Reeve's book.Â  If that's too long, read the 4-page synopsis in the same book.Â  If even that takes too much time, come listen to me talk about it.Â  I'll make it understandable.
