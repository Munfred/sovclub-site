Today being Americans birthday, and this being a club about countries (full of people with no plans whatsoever), it was realized that this was opportune cause for impromptu celebration. Thus it was decided that:



**Today 4 July 2019 at 18:00h on Sovereignty Lounge BBB B101 there shall be an impromptu celebration of America Day™**



We will screen something. Either [this 56min PBS documentary about Nixon](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/nixon/#part01) (if I can ever figure how to watch it online) or this [30min documentary about the American Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzALIXcY4pg&feature=youtu.be) as per Sam's suggestion. Or we can also watch [this](http://www.untoldhistory.com/#about) [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Untold_History_of_the_United_States#Critical_reception).



Also, in true American fashion, we'll be making some [caipirinha](https://www.allrecipes.com/video/5144/caipirinha/). We'll have some snacks, but you're welcome to bring food.



Finally, at 21:00h there's a [30 min fireworks show from Rose Bowl](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/video/4116795-americafest-features-socals-biggest-fireworks-show/) which we can watch from the mountains, or, if we're feeling lazy, the top of the Millikan library.



Cheers
