## As I mentioned last week: Tomorrow there is no official or unnoficial or purported in any manner whatsoever Sovereignty Club meeting.

\*because NeuroTechers, the organization that munificently leases us Sovereignty Lounge under a [compact of free association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_of_Free_Association), requested for using the lounge at September 4, 6PM for an AMA with professor [Ralph Adolphs](http://emotion.caltech.edu/) who studies emotions and stuff. Even though it is called an “AMA” which usually means “Ask Me Anything”, I should note that this abbreviation must stand for something else, because I was told to “Absolutely not” ask him about politics or in any way shape or form derail the event. Even though he studies emotion and human cognition and social behavior. Go figure. Anyway, there will be nice food, but you shouldn’t come just for the food, you should also be able to feign sufficient interest in neuroscience, not ask him about politics, and ideally engage and ask questions directly relevant to the research of Ralph Adolphs or pertinent to academic experience. As the event organizers themselves put it:

> *Tomorrow, Wednesday at 6PM, we will have our 4th guest professor at the Fireside Chat - Ralph Adolphs! This is an informal setting, like a live reddit AMA, so feel free to come by, eat some dinner, and ask Ralph questions about consciousness, emotion, neuroscience generally, or anything else that comes to mind. The idea is to encourage big picture thinking, ask the things you've always wondered about but haven't had answered in classes, and to get to know your professors better. If you're looking for inspiration, you can check out Ralph's lab page here: <http://emotion.caltech.edu/>, but anything is fair game.*

PS: We will have a meeting next week (September 11), but then I'll go travelling between September 16 and October 5, and there is nobody slated to present. This is your chance to make us all proud and hijack Sovereignty Club meetings for arbitrary nefarious purposes. But if nobody steps up as per the [provisional constitution v19.09](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2KZgRUbrxrfKcA5IiHkxdEK2Oe729vmSVcqMzSMovs/edit#), meetings will be adjourned due to an exception being thrown.
