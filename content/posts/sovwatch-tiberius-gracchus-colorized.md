Last week Michael regaled us with the story of Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus , roman brothers who *were murdered by a Senatorial mob--either because they were patriotic citizens who wanted to give food and land to Rome's poor, or because they were dangerous demagogues aiming at nothing less than kingship, depending on your perspective.*



This was the first time that mob politics became a thing in ancient Rome, and once it started it didn't stop (might be tempting to draw a parallel with social media mobs...). How did this come to be? Well, if you missed Michael's presentation, thankfully we stumbled upon a dramatized version!



So tonight we will watching episode 3 of the BBC series [Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01kgjsl/episodes/guide), with the synopsis *How Tiberius Gracchus unleashed the power of the mob upon the streets.*
