Last time, Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus were murdered by a Senatorial mob--either because they were patriotic citizens who wanted to give food and land to Rome's poor, or because they were dangerous demagogues aiming at nothing less than kingship, depending on your perspective. 300,000 barbarians arrived at Italy's northern border, defeating 3 successive Roman armies. In the last defeat at the Battle of Arausio, Rome lost 120,000 men, one of the biggest military disasters in its history. An Italian *novus homo* named Gaius Marius climbed up the political ladder, won 5 consulships, turned Rome's property-owning citizen militias into a professional standing army made up primarily of Rome's poor. These landless soldiers depended on their generals to give them land after their retirement, thus tying their fortunes to their generals' political careers. Marius' military genius and extensive reforms rescued Rome from the existential threat of the Cimbri, but posed a grave danger to the republic.



In today's episode, Mithridates IV orders a genocide of all Roman and Italian citizens. Also, for the first time in the republic's history, an army of the Roman people marches on Rome. A general becomes dictator for life. People get murdered in political purges left and right, either because they associated with the wrong people, or because they have money.
