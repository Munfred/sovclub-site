Evolution shapes human behavior that doesn't change on the timescale of our lives. Culture shapes human behavior that does change in the timescale of our lives. Human behavior shapes society - if you think about it, human behavior actually is society.



Environment, rules, words, shape culture. Can we use science to shape a culture that yields desirable behaviors? Can we do it across societies? Develop a new culture of sustainable behaviors that will keep humankind from destroying itself, and make everyone happier in the process?



One man thought so. A man that [studied pidgeons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhvaSEJtOV8) and extrapolated his findings to humans. Turns out that aside from talking a lot, we are not that different from pidgeons.



That man was [Burrhus Frederic Skinner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner). And he didn't want to stop at individual humans. He proposed his fundings could be applied on larger scales, to design entire communities, shape cultures, and stave off catastrophe.

\
Tonight me and Brenever will present on two essays from Skinner that diagnose the problems, and attempt to sketch an (admittedly rather broad) solution.



One essay is titled ***Why We Are Not Acting to Save the World**,*  and the other ***What Is Wrong with Daily Life in the Western World?***



Easy light topics with clear actionable solutions.



I am attaching both essays, with my annotations. I recommend that you skim them just to read my notes, and I challenge you to decipher my handwriting.



In sovereignty,
