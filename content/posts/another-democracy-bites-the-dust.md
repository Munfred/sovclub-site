[Let‚Äôs go!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY0WxgSXdEE)



[Suu Kyi](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/world/asia/myanmar-coup-aung-san-suu-kyi.html) walks warily down the street

With her [walkie talkie](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2021/0203/Ousted-Myanmar-leader-Suu-Kyi-faces-jail-on-walkie-talkie-charge) way down low

Ain't no sound but for the [aerobics in the plaza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=are7Rfpq-jg)

[Machine guns](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/world/asia/myanmar-coup-photos.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article) ready to go

Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?

Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?

Out of the doorway democracy rip

To the sound of the coup yeah

[Another democracy bites the dust](https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-freedom-world-2020-finds-established-democracies-are-decline)

[Another democracy bites the dust](https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/6855/global-freedom-continues-to-decline-but-promise-of-democracy-endures/)

And another one gone and another one and another democracy gone

Another democracy bites the dust

Hey they're gonna get NATO too.





Tonight we‚Äôll talk about the [world‚Äôs latest coup](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/01/myanmar-miliitary-coup-aung-san-suu-kyi/): Myanmar (aka [Burma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conflict_in_Myanmar)). Michael will fill us in with his beautiful conspiracy theory (do not confuse with [this](https://www.the-sun.com/news/2249050/qanon-conspiracy-theory-myanmar-coup-us-joe-biden/) conspiracy theory), and we‚Äôll proceed to give our own personal reason for why we disagree.



In short, as Michael says:

Here's my conspiracy theory: the military actually loves Aung San Suu Kyi, and always has. She is the daughter of Aung San, the founder of the Myanmar Armed Forces. After her party won an election the first time, she was merely put under house arrest, not even into an actual prison. When the "transition to democracy" happened, the military allowed her to win an election and to take power because it was becoming unpopular and needed relief from sanctions.

Democratic legitimacy in hand, the military and Aung worked together to ethnically cleanse the Rohingyas.¬† Aung tirelessly praised and defended the military's actions, even travelling to the Hague to personally rebut allegations of genocide.This year, as the world was battling a pandemic, the military decided it no longer needed to worry about international sanctions.¬†

The people have gotten enough of a taste of democracy to know it doesn't solve all their problems. And so the military, with the agreement and cooperation of Aung, decided to take back formal power again. By setting up this fake conflict, Aung and the military, working together, distract the citizens from their awful living conditions while keeping power in their own hands



To which Dylan retorts:\
What does Suu Kyi bring to the table? As far as I can tell, she just mollifies westerners. But if the military puts her under bullshit house arrest, isn't her enchantment cancelled? So, why would the military ever engage in an overt "coup" or, if they do coup, why would they keep her around afterwards? In summary, if the only spell she can cast is a [+5 Human Rights Facade](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/797256296612364299/806631867281309726/unknown.png), how is she still valuable to the military? Or does she possess other powers we can't even begin to comprehend...



To which Michael re-retorts:

Also +10 democratic legitimacy, +20 hope. Let's say either the military or Aung hold power indefinitely.¬† People notice their lives aren't improving. That they're still in poverty, only now they can't even leave their homes for fear of the virus. They realize the propaganda was a lie. They get dissatisfied and start demanding something really radical, like communism or fascism.

Aung is the daughter of the founder of the Myanmar Armed Forces. She grew up with these people. It wouldn't surprise me if they've had a close and trusting relationship since she was a child



To which Eduardo adds:

I actually agree with your conspiracy theory. Politics is a game of reputation, and reputation only exists because of persistent identity. It's the major problem blockchain bla bla is yet to solve - persistent identities that enable reputation and trust. Your conspiracy theory is a beautiful way of cheating the system by creating alt-identities that start with 0 bad karma. It's like everyone is a "lame duck politician" and can do whatever they want.



And to which Austin concludes:

I just wanna profit from the shift in [manufacturing](https://www.adb.org/countries/myanmar/economy) from China to Myanmar. That‚Äôs what Lee Kuan Yew would care about.\
