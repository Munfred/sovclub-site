This Wednesday, come hear [Ben Landau-Taylor](https://benlandautaylor.com/ "https\://benlandautaylor.com/") talk about [why it's crazy people who make new industries](https://palladiummag.com/2021/02/02/new-industries-come-from-crazy-people/ "https\://palladiummag.com/2021/02/02/new-industries-come-from-crazy-people/").  Ben is Senior Analyst at [Bismarck Analysis](https://www.bismarckanalysis.com/#/ "https\://www.bismarckanalysis.com/#/"), which "examines institutions, industries, and individuals on behalf of our clients".

For example, this is Boulton, the first industrialist to mass manufacture the steam engine: *"The robbers…were allowed to break in and seize their booty, and were making off with 150 guineas and a load of silver, when Boulton gave the word to seize them. A quantity of tow soaked with turpentine was instantly set fire to, numerous lights were turned on, and the robbers found themselves surrounded on all sides by armed men. Four of them were taken after a desperate struggle; but the fifth, though severely wounded, contrived to escape over the tops of the houses in Brook-row."*

Industrial breakthroughs go along with big changes in social structures. New types of organization are needed to manage the new industry, there are changes to the elite as wealth and power are created and distributed, and the new products and technologies themselves change society directly. Some societies are set up to allow these changes, and others are set up to stop them before they disrupt the status quo. This talk will examine how industrial breakthroughs affect society, using case studies ranging from medieval agriculture to the moon landing.
