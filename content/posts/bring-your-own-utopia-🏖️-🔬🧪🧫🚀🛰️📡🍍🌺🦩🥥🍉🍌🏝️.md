Imagine you are tasked with creating an institution like [Stanford University](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=6377d7843f&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!9co6I_af_EKQn0qO704FsrhIwiGZeLQo2T_jUZ5pqC-HxDTl3KELrKTSqlGmtLw87fl5f6YeXn02_3yzk0o-r7afaKqjCA$) today and the surrounding ethos ( VC funds, startups and so on ), but instead of California you have to do it in [Floripa](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=d8e68e99c5&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!9co6I_af_EKQn0qO704FsrhIwiGZeLQo2T_jUZ5pqC-HxDTl3KELrKTSqlGmtLw87fl5f6YeXn02_3yzk0o-r7bvYQtGQA$). Rather than starting from by riches accrued over a lifetime of [rent seeking](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=108eced634&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!9co6I_af_EKQn0qO704FsrhIwiGZeLQo2T_jUZ5pqC-HxDTl3KELrKTSqlGmtLw87fl5f6YeXn02_3yzk0o-r7b1C4bZpg$) in farmland, you are surrounded by poverty in a tropical paradise. Instead of being funded by your own deep pockets, you have to generate the wealth to materialize this vision in the coming years through businesses serving market demands.

What would you teach?\
What would the campus look like?\
What heaven and belief system would you promote?\
What temple would be at the center of your campus?\
What business would you put in place to fund your campus?\
How would you find the people to run the businesses and work at them?

\
Come to SovClub tonight to paint your utopia, the God you serve (God as in the highest good you can conceive, the pinnacle of your value system) so as to have a society flourish around it.

Eduardo will also put forward his heaven and an invitation to have a taste of it while on earth: tldr, it involves a lot of cachaça and Carnaval in Floripa.\
As a matter of fact, you can already sign up for it here: [https://munfred.com/come_to_floripa](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=2806cb9a1e&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!9co6I_af_EKQn0qO704FsrhIwiGZeLQo2T_jUZ5pqC-HxDTl3KELrKTSqlGmtLw87fl5f6YeXn02_3yzk0o-r7ZR_ITIRA$)\
