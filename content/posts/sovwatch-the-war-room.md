Tonight at sovwatch we'll be watching another documentary about American politics (this is not sovclub after all, so we're allowed to keep talking about the same country, besides no one else makes movies about politics anyway). This time it's about the (Bill) Clinton campaign from 1992: [The War Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Room). The cool thing it's all original footage, not some silly reenactment.



Join us at 5PM: [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)\

In sovereignty,\
