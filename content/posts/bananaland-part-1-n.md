After Michael regaled us with his incredible Roman Empire series, we will try to honor this new tradition of high standards with another multi part series about Brazil, brought to you with much love, hatred, and strong emotions, by two of the most Brazil spiting Brazillians you could find around.



Per Michael's suggestion, we'll try our best to diligently cover the 8 fundamental pillars of modern civilizations: history, culture, politics, economy, philosophy, religion, demographics and art. We will certainly fail, but fear not, don't despair, don't worry, don't take it too seriously. As you will soon learn, non-seriousness is one of the most deeply ingrained aspects of brazilian (and I daresay latin) culture. Much like "socialism with chinese characteristics" is shorthand for whatever it is that the CCP does, "zueira" is shorthand for the ethos, mindset, culture and philosophy of whatever it is that brazilians do, however they do it.



We thought this was only going to be a two part series, but the more we look at the slides the more we want to berate Brazil, and it keeps going. We're now at 116 slides and counting…\

There's not required reading or prep for this, but if you want to get a taste of what we're talking about, [read this open letter to Brazil](https://markmanson.net/brazil), by an American. If you just want to get a taste of peak political drama in 2016, [see here](https://medium.com/@RachelG/a-breakdown-of-brazil-s-political-crisis-d334bd26c031). For peak drama in 2017, [see here](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/world/americas/brazil-michel-temer-joesley-batista-corruption.html). And if you just care about the memes, [see here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/952290/Zueirama/).



See you tonight at 6pm cartime,



and at 5:30pm cartime if you want to talk about the first two chapters of World Order.
