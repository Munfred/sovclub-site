**Above**: The [2020-2021 Indian farmer protests](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=a93c27d365&e=ee534c915d) against the [Farm Bills](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=5166df73eb&e=ee534c915d), which would have “deregulated a system of government-run wholesale markets, allowing farmers to sell directly to food processors, but farmers feared that this would result in the end of government-guaranteed price floors, thereby reducing the prices they would receive for their crops”.

Sovereignty Club member, passionate left-wing Indian activist, and now-filmmaker Rajashik Tarafder will talk about the history of American agricultural policy. Here is his summary:

*The opening up of U.S. agriculture and contract farming brought ruin to small family farms across America. As a result, the median U.S. farm income today is negative $1,800 dollars. Farmers are struggling to feed themselves. Are the 2020 Indian Farm Laws taking Indian agriculture down that same path? We will explore answers to this question and view some footage of a new documentary, titled "Déjà Vu," featuring recent interviews with U.S. farmers who shed light on the current farm worker protests in India.*
