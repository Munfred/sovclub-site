If you are bored, feel you need new friends, think you don't have enough of America already or just crave popcorn, come by. All are welcome, even me. I might be there is I'm bored/tired/done with work (impossibru)/feel everything is futile and that nothing matters anyway.



**Disclaimer:** Movie Night™ is not sponsored by Sovereignty Club, it is is sponsored by [NeuroTechers](http://neurotechers.caltech.edu/). We are just friends and stuff. If you like Movie Night™ email Lev at [ltsypin@caltech.edu](mailto:ltsypin@caltech.edu) to get on their mailing list.





**Important notice:**\
Due to several exceptions being thrown (Eduardo not found. He's in Europe) Sovereignty Club next expected meeting is on **October 9,** when we will learn the truth about e-Estonia and the Nordic Countries. If you feel like throwing a meeting or a [coup](https://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/t/official-continuous-election-thread/143/2) please do. I can give you the email list.
