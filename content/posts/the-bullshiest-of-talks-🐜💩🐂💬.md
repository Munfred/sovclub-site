**The Bullshiest of talks\
by everyone**

Things fell through with our slated speaker and now everyone is stepping in to fill the void. Please propose a topic. Here’s what we got so far:

* The importance of face-to-face interaction in building political and social consciousness among groups, by Dylan, where he argues zoom calls still kind of counts as face to face interaction
* A quick look at the City of London, by Austin, where he also compares it to the we can also compare it to the City of Amsterdam before Napoleon invaded
* Alcoholic dispatches from Bananaland, by Eduardo, where a solution for the malaises afflicting people in modern cities is provided
