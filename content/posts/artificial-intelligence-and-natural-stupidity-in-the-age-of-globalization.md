This week at Sovereignty Club we will talk about artificial intelligence and natural stupidity in the age of globalization. We will learn about the many ways that the rise of AI is likely to cause social unrest and instability, from the obvious like fake news to more subtle forms like widespread identity fraud and misinformation. We will learn about the ways in which policies and laws that attempt to stop these kinds of things will have to adapt and adapt we will, but first we will discuss the weather.\
\
We will discuss the rise of artificial intelligence advisory boards and the rise of advisory councils of super-intelligent AI's. We will also talk about the ethics of artificial intelligence and the ethics of stupidity.\
\
In the past, globalization was seen as a way for countries to move around and improve their comparative advantage over their international competitors. But globalization has evolved into a global governance structure that is increasingly focused on promoting the interests of the world's largest economies at the expense of everyone else. As globalization takes hold, countries around the world are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence and other such global solutions to address problems that were once solved through the direct intervention of states.\
\
This week's theme came about because we decided to play around a little and came up with our own. In the future, instead of having nations, instead of having currencies, we will have people. Humans. Humans who will one day be able to buy drugs on the black market, evade laws by shifting allegiances, upload video game saves of themselves playing video games to a cloud service, and generally do bad things because humans do bad things because world peace is our highest priority.\
\
So, this week we are going to talk about natural stupidity and the coming global collapse. Every generation, humanity comes up with some crazy idea. Some of these ideas are good. Some of these ideas are even better than the one it follows. But, eventually, civilization falls. A horrible, but inevitable, by-product of human hubris and desire to dominate the universe.\
\
But, what about all the time that was never spent dominating the universe? All that time that was spent making stupid things? All the people that would have been alive had humanity fallen ill with some other pandemonger? Humanity itself. Who would have been the one to bring about the global collapse? Not them, though. The market would have. When the bubble bursts, governments step in to take over the businesses when they burst, and to prop up the failed state when it crumbles.\
\
This is what is known as "enterprise-malbouket" and it is what would have brought about the global collapse.\
\
But not all innovations are good for the world. Not all markets are good for the world. Not all inventions are good for the world. And not all inventions are good for the sole purpose of making stupid things worse.\
\
Innovation is a word that conjures up images of steam engines and Gutenberg presses, but it really describes two things. The first was a wonderful attempt at building a universal postal service by 19th century Russian immigrant galleons, and the second is a terrible idea that has caused untold suffering around the world and will likely cause untold more in the future.\
\
Why should globalization make us all less safe and just as prone to disaster like cause as before?\
\
What kinds of policies might we want to promote to make a dent in these and other risks to global well being?\
\
Could we achieve greater benefits by promoting a mixture of risk and reward and promoting direct cooperation between the economically powerful and the economically weaker as well as among the economically weaker and the economically powerful as opposed to the other way around?\
\
Please join us this Wednesday at 6pm in Sovereignty Lounge BB8 BBB B101 for a great conversation about artificial intelligence and societal consequences of its adoption.\

PS: This is going to sound like a lecture, and I promise you that I will lose a lot of grammar points, but I promise. If you don't get into it, just leave and come back tomorrow and we will reconvene.\

PPPS: If you're wondering how come the email came in early this week, it is because it was actually written by sovbot, a [pretrained AI language model](<>) that I then refined with some extra training on all Sovereignty Club emails (about 21k words, shockingly) using a colab notebook from [this blog post](https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/). Except for the first sentence, which is used as a prompt, and this PPPS, all the rest of the text was generated by sovbot (not all at once, I picked the best \*paragraphs\* because this was only the \*mid-tier\* model). If you want to hear more from sovbot, [here are another 50k words from it.](https://pastebin.com/raw/4cizBNYr)
