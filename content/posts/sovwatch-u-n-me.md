During this week sovcall, I asked *what movie should we see on* sovwatch*?*We ended up, as one naturally does, gooling. *"best political movies"*, *"best international political movies"* and, eventually, naturally, of course, *"best movies about the UN"*. And, guess what? The internet - Wikipedia! - did not disappoint. We found the glorious wikipedia [Category on Films about the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Films_about_the_United_Nations). What a treasure trove. With 31 entries, we didn't get around checking them all on the call. But boy, did it not disappoint.



In it figure classics like *[Ameriggedon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCoJ7GvOHL8)*, a film that was shot on a ranch and "*describes a fictional attack on the United States by its own government, working in concert with a global Elitist organization and the United Nations."* Or, [Amerika](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CKD4ccc62s), an entire miniseries from 1987 which is kinda like the man in the high castle except with...the Soviet Union. Or, going down the list alphabetically (because that's what I was doing until Valentine called me on it), the [Animatrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animatrix) anime, with not [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0K6Cb1ZoG4) but [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNiO2sTe2wo) pieces about...the UN...kinda.



At this point I stop doing alphabetically and looks though the list until OMG THERES A MOVIE CALLED ***"U.N. me"*** ?!?!?1111 Sure enough, there is, and in the story it "*depicts the United Nations as an organization that has drifted from its founding principles to the point where it now enables evil and sows global chaos". "LOL"*, I lol'd, "that's not even far from the truth. But it implies the UN has real agency, which is not really credible. Still, might be good for a fiction movie". "It's not a fiction movie" said Valentine (reading off my screen), "it is a documentary". "Oh" I said. "that's why it sounded kinda realistic". And sure enough, it is.



Please, if you do nothing else, [watch the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIzDt5NPYfI). It's the most sovclub trailer I've ever seen. Seriously.



The film is made by this conservative center-right leaning guy who quit his job at Lehman Brothers and, who wikipedia says:

> *In addition to admiring Michael Moore's documentary style, Horowitz has confessed to being influenced by [Sacha Baron Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacha_Baron_Cohen "Sacha Baron Cohen")'s interviewing technique, and has said that he "was so enamored with" both Moore's and Baron Cohen's approaches to filmmaking that he "hired much of their teams."[\[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.N._Me#cite_note-ivn-10) Writers from [The Daily Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Show "The Daily Show"), [The Onion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Onion "The Onion"), and from [Michael Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore "Michael Moore")'s films contributed to the documentary.[\[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.N._Me#cite_note-CSPAN-2)*



The Onion meets Michael Moore meets the Daily Show the UN meets an angsty-center-right-learning-​guy-who-makes-a-movie? It's like a match made in heaven. Except it was made in 2006-2009.



So, please, join us tomorrow, at 5PM on our usual zoom at [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668). The film is not available in Netflix...nor it would seem, anywhere else on the internet. Fortunately, thank the the lord *the Internet Archive,* it is available here: [https://archive.org/details/U.​N.Me_Ami.Horovitz](https://archive.org/details/U.N.Me_Ami.Horovitz)



If you are thankful, [give the Internet Archive money](https://archive.org/donate/).



Now, because this is such a special movie, and nobody will be able to stay quiet for more than 5 seconds, we'll be keeping zoom on, and we'll just try to sync our video feeds manually, and then scream over each other *and* over UN people screaming over each other. It will be great.

See you at 5PM cartime!



Eduardo



PS: If you come tomorrow I'll tell you about how I found *the best* cachaça.



PSS: Alphabetically, right after U.N. me, is this [U.N.R.R.A.](http://u.n.r.r.a/) [short movie](https://media.dlib.indiana.edu/media_objects/jh343s46b) from 1944. It's like the UN before the UN. So inspirational. So much to fall short of.
