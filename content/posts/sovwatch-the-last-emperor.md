Tonight at 5PM cartime we will watch [The Last Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Emperor), an "epic biographical drama film" that accompanies the life of Puyi, who was China's last emperor*. It is a really cool looking film, and it is four hours long, so we will split the watch in two.



See you at 5PM at [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)
