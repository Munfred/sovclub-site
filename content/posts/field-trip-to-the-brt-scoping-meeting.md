Hello my compatriots!



This Wednesday eve at 5:20 sharp we meet just outside the usual location, and at 5:30 we ride the bus to the Caltech Senior Center, to a meeting that starts at 6 pm.



Pasadena's mayor, Mr. Terry Tornek, commented that it could be problematic to extend the proposed BRT east of the Gold Line. How shortsighted!



It is up to us to ensure that the NoHo-Pasadena BRT line extends past the Gold Line. And as a secondary mission, we prefer route G, which puts a bus stop one block closer to Caltech!



And then, we will go out to dinner.



Here is my presentation from last week:

Together we triumph,
