⚠️⚠️⚠️ Step right up to the most exciting, terrifying, surprising, unpredictable thrill ride in two-hundred and fifty-two million years!!!⚠️⚠️⚠️ 

Attendance of the entire human circus🦍🎪 on this Earth system roller coaster🌏🎢 is mandatory, and oh boy does it go up-up-up↗️!  Get strapped in and brace yourself for high acceleration✨, loop-de-loops of cascading systems failure ➰, and likely dismemberment🤕. 

Tonight at Sovclub we'll be taking a look at the roller coaster, how it works and its historical ups and downs.  An overview of Earth system dynamics🌎, carbon cycling🌋, feedback🔄, thresholds 〰️, deep time ♾️ 📅🦖🦕, and our wonderful, fantastic, spectacular atmospheric carbon bomb🛢️⛽💣  If we all lean into the curve, can we accelerate this coaster into a record breaking, catastrophic, ☝️#️⃣1️ global mass extinction🦑🐅🐍🦐📉⚰️ ☠️❓❓  Time will tell⏳⏳⏳ (and less time than you think).

Part two (next week) will peer into the near and long term future of the roller coaster, and how the occupants will scramble over each other in a futile attempt to escape the most extreme conditions.  A litany of inevitable effects and speculation on their severity over the coming centuries🔮📅.  Including (but not limited to); wildfires 🌲🔥, cold snaps❄️, floods🌊, droughts🏜️, heatwaves🌡️, storms🌩️🌀🌪️, crop failures🌾, sea level rise 🏊, ocean acidification💧, extinction☠️ and disease🤮. An exploration of how cascading ecosystem failure, unprecedented migration and climate refugees will drive the dynamics of 🇸 🇴 🇻 🇪 🇷 🇪 🇮 🇬 🇳 nations 🌊🌊🙇🙇🏠🔥🏙️🌪️🏦🏙️🧟🏃‍♂️🤸🏃🏼‍♀️ 🏳‍🟧‍⬛‍🟧‼️  And most importantly, advice on how to PROFIT from this wonderful mess 💰💰💸💸

Join us tonight at 18:00 Pacific time, I'm expecting you! https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668
