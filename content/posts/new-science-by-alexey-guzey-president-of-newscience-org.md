As you may be aware if you read sovmail at all, this week we will have a very special guest: [Alexey Guxey](https://guzey.com/), PRESIDENT of [newscience.org](https://newscience.org/). He’s gonna tell us what New Science is all about, because we spent a good 3 hours last week trying to figure it out and couldn't. This meeting is so special in fact that I’m sending the email several days early, because I want you to actually read it. Shocking, I know. Attendees will be barely able to recognize sovclub. 



Because this is a SPECIAL meeting, we’re gonna do things in a special way (which is to say, [unconstitutionally](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2KZgRUbrxrfKcA5IiHkxdEK2Oe729vmSVcqMzSMovs/edit)): in order to best use Alexey’s time, we are going to be starting the actual topic at 6PM sharp, skipping bullshit (but don’t worry, I’m confident it will creep back in). 



In order to double use Alexey’s time well, we have a second innovation: we’re collecting the questions that we have about New Science in [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ia8MzO4YFp1rdN-arfLWcWZC32baUg8mXzhic4XIEoo/edit?usp=sharing). 



[So please add your questions to this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ia8MzO4YFp1rdN-arfLWcWZC32baUg8mXzhic4XIEoo/edit?usp=sharing)



I asked Alexey what we should read to come prepared for the discussion, and he said to poke around his website [guzey.com](https://guzey.com/), and to especially read his report [How Life Sciences Actually Work: Findings of a Year-Long Investigation](https://guzey.com/how-life-sciences-actually-work/), which is directly relevant to New Science.



It is in fact so relevant that I copy the whole table of contents.
