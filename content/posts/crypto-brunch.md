Hello all! Sovereignty club is proud to host our first special event (i.e. not on a Wednesday 6pm)!

The Caltech [Sovereignty Club](http://caltechsovereignty.club/) and [Blockchain Club](http://blockchain.caltech.edu/about/) are co-organizing a digital privacy workshop this Sunday, June 2, from 11am-2pm at Hameetman Center room 210. All are welcome. Topics discussed will include:

* PGP encryption for email
* VPN/Tor usage
* End-to-end encryption in messaging apps
* Password management

If this sounds like gibberish, don’t worry! We’ll have short introduction presentations and be on hand to help answer questions. People may branch out into different groups to co-work/learn. We will adjust topics based on the survey responses (there will be brunch!). Please RSVP here: [ttps://docs.google.com/​forms/d/e/​1FAIpQLScUdbWZjhN29W2byP2MZYtC​nm1i81OJhc-gDsox5CPY6a2CFA/​viewform?usp=sf_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUdbWZjhN29W2byP2MZYtCnm1i81OJhc-gDsox5CPY6a2CFA/viewform?usp=sf_link)\
Please note: absolutely no discussion of cryptocurrency trading or prices will happen.\

Kind regards,\
