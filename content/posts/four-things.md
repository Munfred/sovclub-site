Life continues to happen. Michael continues to write his grants. And Dylan continues to promise us that one day he'll run a meeting. Not today tho.



Due to the universe I have been unable to organize a coherent thoughtstream on anything in particular for this week's discussion, so instead here are four disparate things:



1) Foreign Affairs published what I consider to be [the best essay about America I've ever read](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-16/superpower-it-or-not) (attached). Debate me. 



2) Next  the Caltech Y has an awesome lineup of [four talks about countries](https://www.caltechy.org/so/4aNYu2WkZ?languageTag=en&cid=1132dd0e-1acd-4f82-bb6b-0175a764c2f8#/main) as part of world fest, sadly without the food this year. Still, you should attend. It's like 25% Singapore 50% international kerfuffle 25% random ass country Kazakhstan.



3) I have randomly listened to [this 1 hour interview podcast with Jeremy Grantham](https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/31390529/grantham-a-historic-market-bubble?tab=mentionedcontent), whom I had (literally) never heard of before, and I immediately became a total fan. He's like a british investor guy that talks common sense, history, and uses it to think about the future. Highly recommend.



4) I got antsy this weekend, so I did [this](https://www.catarse.me/ivgpodecrer). Look at it and tell me what you think. For context see [this](https://www.caltechsovereignty.club/institutional-advancement). And [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oRU-Op5yOljOzQMFSvs_oSPoWP9yMWswoij39X2oO8s/edit?usp=sharing).





So yeah. See you today at 6PM cartime [https://caltech.zoom.​us/j/4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)



In sovereignty,



Eduardo



PS: Do look at #4 then tell me what you think.
