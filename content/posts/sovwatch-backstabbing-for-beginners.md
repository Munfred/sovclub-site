Apologies for not sending this early. I assume everyone is holed up at home in front of their computers anyway so probably not too much damage done. We'd like to have another sovwatch today around 5pm california time. **If you'd like to join ping me so that we don't forget you.** Here's the usual zoom link: [https://caltech.zoom.us/​j/4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)

We will be watching [Backstabbing for Begi​nners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstabbing_for_Beginners), a movie based on the whistle-blower book by the same name that tells the story of the UN's biggest corruption scandal ever: the Oil for Food program. It seems to be available on [amazon prime](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.f0b17272-647a-e950-788d-37ae3e5d9061?camp=1789&creativeASIN=B07CJLYPZ9&ie=UTF8&linkCode=xm2&tag=justwatch09-20)

Cheers
