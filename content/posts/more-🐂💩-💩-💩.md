I continue to be busy. Sovclub slowly withers away. I won't even be participating in most of the meeting on October 27 because I'm flying back to LA.



Come tonight 6PM, hijack the meeting, talk about whatever you want: See you tonight at 6PM: [https://caltech.zoom.us/​my/sovcall](https://caltech.zoom.us/my/sovcall)

PS: There is *still* time to make it to the acknowledgements of my [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AFsJQTA_8bNlPt4LidNFdU0rNfODQoFz/view?usp=sharing), just show up to sovcall and make a contribution!
