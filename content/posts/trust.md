In a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX8HjUC77Q4) he gave at MIT in 2002 (highly recommended), David Baltimore talked about [trust](https://wi.mit.edu/news/nobel-laureate-david-baltimore-tackles-issues-trust). He discussed primarily trust in the context of doing science, something on which he is uniquely qualified to discuss*. Science, when we stop to think about it, has a LOT of trust EVERYWHERE. Even though you are always skeptical of everything everyone says, you always assume people are not lying, just wrong. You default to believing what people are telling you, and assume everyone has good intentions. It is very freeing. Instead of spending mental effort worrying about being tricked, you can devote it to showing why people are wrong (or, occasionally, right).



Trust might actually be at the root cause of why science works so well. (True, the rewards for scientific misconduct are so small - PDFs on the internet? Fame within a circle of half a dozen people? Giving a conference keynote talk which nobody in your family can understand? -Â  that you canâ€™t help but wonder why anyone smart enough to commit scientific fraud would bother doing it instead of more profitable frauds.)



Can you think of a single other human enterprise that comes close to the global scale of science that engenders the same level of trust? Journalism? Banking? Politics? Corporate announcements?



The only settings in which I can conceive the same level of trust are those of small communities, villages, where everyone knows everyone and there are repeated interactions, making reputation fundamental. Caltechâ€™s small size is certainly what enables it to continue running off the honour code. You quickly learn you should be nice to everyone you meet, because you will run into them again - sooner rather than later, and again and again.Â 



Trust immensely lowers transaction and operational costs, by virtue of reducing or eliminating the apparatus and mechanisms needed to ensure compliance. Indeed, a modicum of trust is necessary for virtually any kind of transaction (blockchain notwithstanding - the oracle problem is still most easily solvable with trust).



I do wonder if a high trust environment is a secret sauce ingredient of functional societies. [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/trust) has an interesting article discussing trust indicators in multiple countries against various metrics. From that article, perhaps most interesting is trustâ€™s strong correlation with GDP per capita, and negative correlation with income inequality (if you exclude China...whose data points are hard to trust...).



Perhaps trust is also the secret sauce of Silicon Valley. VCs trust founders to do a good job and thud do not burden them with onerous terms, founders trust other founders for advice and help, and trust their employees to just do it. But all this trust is likely enabled by repeat interactions of a small community - VCs have a reputation to keep, and founders are often serial entrepeneurs, a happy little village of billionaires.Â 



If village-like settings with small communities, reputations and repeated interactions fundamentally underpin functional societies, what does that say about the concept of [global village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_village)? Hmmm.

\*Starting in 1986 one of Baltimoreâ€™s collaborators, [Thereza Imanishi-Kari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thereza_Imanishi-Kari), was accused of fraud on a paper he was coauthor on by a disgruntled postdoc. The whole thing snowballed immensely and it eventually went from a university investigation on simple scientific error to whole congressional hearings pitting Baltimore against John Dingell, a representative who seized the whole thing as a political banner of battling fraud in science. Good thing Baltimore is articulate, fearless, has a giant ego and never backs off\*\*. It was a [ten year long odyssey](http://web.mit.edu/chemistryrcr/Downloads/Baltimore.pdf) chronicled in a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Baltimore-Case-Politics-Science-Character/dp/0393319709) but by [1996 it emerged that Dingell had bullied the secret service into doing his own political biddings](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/20/specials/baltimore-bully.html) and the whole thing had zero due process, because when the accused could finally could examine the evidence being levied against them (lab notebooks!) the whole case [evaporated](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/25/opinion/the-fraud-case-that-evaporated.html).
