This week, for the first time ever, we're holding a joint event with Pi Club at Pasadena Community College.  My PCC friend Samy Meftoul, who previously came to Sovereignty Club to talk about Morocco, is president of Pi Club.  He is organizing Pi Week, a series of talks and workshops centered around STEM.  He wanted an international and interdisciplinary component to the week, and Sovereignty Club was a great fit!  On Wednesday, we're holding our weekly meeting **on the PCC campus and on a PCC Zoom link**.  Pizza, pies, and drinks will be provided courtesy of Pi Club.  RSVP is required if you want to attend in person, but not required for Zoom.  

Caltech students are also invited to check out other Pi Week events.  The schedule and registration link are here: <https://pasadena.edu/academics/divisions/mathematics/pi-day.php>

**In person:** PCC building G, room 1.  See map.  (***Not my apartment!***)\

**Summary:** Professor and lawyer, Tom W. Bell, will report on three new sovereigns he has helped build:  [Próspera ZEDE](https://prospera.hn/) in Roatán, Honduras; the recently launched Catawba Indian Nation's [Green Earth Zone](https://catawbacorps.com/news/the-catawba-general-council-approves-digital-economic-zone-in-catawba-lands/); and the forthcoming [Free Society](https://www.freesociety.com/) project.  All three incorporate code from [Ulex](https://github.com/ulex-opensource/Ulex/tree/master/versions/1.2), the open source legal system.  All three use cryptocurrencies and other blockchain technologies to optimize governance.

**Speaker biography:** Prof. Tom W. Bell earned a J.D. from the University of Chicago, practiced law in Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C., and served as a policy director for the Cato Institute before joining the faculty of Chapman University Fowler School of Law.  He teaches all of the first-year common law courses and electives in high-tech, entertainment, and intellectual property.  Bell writes about special jurisdictions, copyright, Internet law, prediction markets, and the Third Amendment (the one about quartering troops).  He created Ulex, the open source legal system, for clients developing private governments, and recently recorded an updated audio version of *[Your Next Government?  From the Nation State to Stateless Nations](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Next-Government-Stateless-Nations/dp/1316613925)* (Cambridge University Press 2018).  Bell serves as Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Special Jurisdictions, which he co-founded.  He advises The Seasteading Institute (pro bono), Pronomos Capital, and the Free Society Project, among others.
