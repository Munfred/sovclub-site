Do you like MONEY??? What if I told you that you might just be able to make lots and lots of money by doing nothing and signing this exciting new contract that you're not going to read the fine print of and handing me some cash? Just sign on the dotted line and start making your money work for you! 

Is this contract I'm handing you illegal? Well, considering the US government has gone out of its way to not make a ruling on this market's legality for decades, I don't think you should bother them with your pesky inquiries. What if you think I won't pay you out? Can you take me to court to make sure I pay you the money I "owe" you? Well, the wonderful thing is that if you do and get the court to rule in your favor, you might just cause a wide-reaching cascade of new legal precedents that will lead to massive financial restructuring of some of the country's biggest businesses due to the newfound (il)legality of this new category of contracts! And you wouldn't want to be responsible for the huge market crash that would ensue, right?

Wait... who's that over there? Is that CTFC chair Brooksley Born trying to figure out how to control our money? We can't have that! Grab your pitchforks and let's get her!\
