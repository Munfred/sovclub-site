**Alcoholism and Eastern Europe**

🇸🇮🍸🍻🥂🍷🥃🇸🇮

Hi everyone, tonight we this week we have Eva Kercmar, from Slovenia, who going to tell us  about alcoholism in Eastern Europe.





🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮



Additionally, we have a special message from Mr. President, Leonid Pereiaslov: we are looking for new people to tell us about their world.\
\
*We ask students of interesting ethnocultural backgrounds (and there are plenty of those around here) to participate in our series of talks, intended for sharing their worldview and knowledge of life in the home countries with others.*

*Just to remind you who we are - the Sovereignty Club of Caltech, a meta-but-actually-also-physical place with a great appreciation for the exchange of different cultural and world views, where we discuss current geopolitical events, cultural and historical phenomena of the World and invite guests among scholars, journalists, politicians etc. We are meeting at 17:30 at our sovlounge, BBB B101, as well as online on Zoom every Wednesday, and would be eager to see some new faces around.*
