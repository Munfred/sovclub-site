Alas, Austin got bogged down with life and can't present this week. But fear not, for we have an ever going stream of topics to discuss. So this week we will talk about….[Homonationa](https://polcompball.fandom.com/wiki/Homonationalism)... Ethnonationalism! Et al. [Two](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2008-03-02/us-and-them) [wonderful](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-02-12/your-brain-nationalism) [articles](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3311957.3359495?download=true) are attached, check them out! This is a topic that seems to be...rather relevant in America right now? Hm. Anyhows, in lieu of a beautifully crafted email, here's a Greek dialogue hangouts chat that unfolded as I tried to think what to write:

Wow, the us vs them paper is really good.



I don't buy that ethnonationalism was responsible for the rise of nation states, otherwise you can't explain Latin America, the US, and all the English speaking British colonies that became independent over the past 2 centuries. But, it certainly was the defining feature for choosing where to put the boundaries when breaking the empires. For all the reasons they point out.



But you know, I had been thinking about this Ethnonationalism thing, And the american racism thing, and irony of ironies, America and Latin America seem to present a tantalizing blueprint for a civilizational model where we actually do overcome ethnonationalism.



Here's my take on it. Overcoming ethnonationalism requires:

1) A cultural change to become more accepting of other peoples

2) Actual demographic change where people mix more



Interestingly, in Latin America, by virtue of the Spanish and Portuguese conquests which promoted cultural genocide and lots of racial mingling, that process has been ongoing for 400 years. And in Brazil in the past 200 years you got the addition of european immigration (which, yeah, was aimed at bringing in more white people), but due to what i can only describe as the laxness of latin culture, people mingled instead of segregating. And segregation is actually the one crucial difference between racism in Latin America and in the US. In the US, and I didn't really appreciate how much, the actual demographics remained segregated long after the end of slavery.



That I can only ascribe to cultural factors. "white" in the US is quite distinct from "white" in Brazil, where in reality virtually everyone is mixed. Somehow the US managed to keep segregation going for a very long time, to this day. It's probably a puritan thing. If you're gonna have less sex, might aswell be picky about your partners and go with the ones of the same race,



~finds [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_marriage_in_the_United_States#:~:text=Interracial%20marriage%20in%20the%20United%20States%20has%20been%20legal%20throughout,%2Dmiscegenation%22%20laws%20were%20unconstitutional.) on wikipedia~ Oh I see, that makes a lot of sense. So, even though slavery ended in 1860s, desegration only started 100 years later. Meanwhile brazil whose slavery only ended in 1888 has arguably a several generation lead in desegregation. Either way, I do believe that the Americas, north, south, middle, are ahead of most of the rest of the world in this integrationist regard.

"And a survey would show that whereas in 1900 there were many states in Europe without a single overwhelmingly dominant nationality,by 2007 there were only two, and one of those, Belgium, was close to breaking up.Aside from Switzerland, in other words—where the domestic ethnic balance of power is protected by strict citizenship laws—in Europe the “separatist project” has not so much vanished as triumphed."



"One could argue that Europe has been so harmonious since World War II not because of the failure of ethnic nationalism but because of its success,which removed some of the greatest sources of conflict both within and between countries. The fact that ethnic and state boundaries now largely coincide has meant that there are fewer disputes over borders or expatriate communities, leading to the most stable territorial configuration in European history"



Imagine if this was true, that ethnic purity is necessary for a peaceful and stable democracy to flourish. When I first read the paper, I thought it couldn't be true, but there's been a major resurgence in identity politics recently from both left and right, showing that nationalism hasn't disappeared, and might not ever disappear.



What about countries that are highly diverse, like most countries in the world? When I first read the paper, I thought the inevitable future of the US would be a post-racial society where everyone is free to speak their mind in a lively democracy. Nowadays, that increasingly doesn't seem to be the future, because who wants a post racial society anymore?

The left, who stokes ethnic tensions every chance they get using terms like "white privilege" and promoting nationalism from all non-white groups? Or the right, who's increasingly adopting populist anti-immigrant stances?



Historically the development of democracy has been intimately tied to the development of nationalism. "the people's voice" only makes sense if there's such a thing as "the people" that voters identify with and care about. Maybe it'll turn out that multiculturalism is simply incompatible with a functional democracy in the long term, and that we'll either go back to multiethnic empires ruled by autocrats, or ethno-nation states that became that way due to ethnic cleansing and forced assimilation. Or alternatively, we become one of those failed states in Africa where identity politics are the end-all be-all of democracy, and a fragile balance of power poised on a knife's edge is the only thing standing between the country and genocide

So the options are:



1) Post-racial society

2) Multiethnic empire ruled by autocrat

3) Ethno-nation state following ethnic cleansing, forced assimilation, and/or population transfers from and into separatist states

4) A state with an ethnic balance of power poised on the knife's edge, ready to descend into chaos at any moment

5) Other



Which one do you think is the most likely future of the US, say in 50 years' time?



Eduardo: 4. In 100 years, 1



Michael: Wow, such a quick transition from 4 to 1?



Eduardo: America has \_always\_ been 4. Brazil has always been 4.



Michael: The thing is, Latin America isn't that inspiring in terms of human development. America is, but its people have lost faith in overcoming ethnonationalism because both the left and the right can't resist the appeal.



Eduardo: That's the thing, it's not Africa. The lowest you can go is Venezuela. And racism can’t do that, only communism.



Michael: Not really, there was never any threat of a real race war in America



Eduardo: Civil war?



Michael: That was white on white violence.



Eduardo: Ahhh sorry I didn't see the word "ethnic" in #4. Blame the alcohol.





See you tomorrow!

PS: Michael, upon reviewing this email: LOL, you literally copy-and-pasted the conversation.



PSS: Eduardo: Yes. Should I add the word literally on the email?
