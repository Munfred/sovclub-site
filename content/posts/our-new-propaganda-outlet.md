Greetings fellow conscripts,



As you may have heard during today's meeting, my team is running uncontested for the editorial positions in the school's newspaper, The California Tech. In our perpetual search for more content, I am requesting your assistance in writing articles or a biweely column for the paper. This club has led to many thought-provoking conversations which I hope we can share with more of the undergraduate population, including (but not limited to):

* COVID-19 Biot\*rr\*rism: The Solution to All of America's Problems?
* The Rwandan Genocide: National Scale Privatization Done Right
* "We'll be racist right back!": International Politics Under Chinese Control

If any of you are interested in getting paid to write stories like this (serious or not), please contact me directly at kthai@. The April Fool's issue is coming up soon, so we want as many high quality articles as we can get.



To freedom of the press!

Kenny
