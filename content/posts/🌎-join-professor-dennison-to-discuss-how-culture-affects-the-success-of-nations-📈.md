**TLDR: join us Saturday, January 30, at 11 am PST for an informal discussion with our very first faculty guest speaker: Professor Tracy Dennison, who studies how societies worked in the past and how societal rules and norms affect the decisions people made about their lives.  Invite everyone.  The link, as always, is https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668**



Remember those pre-COVID days when you could travel✈️to other countries?  If you went anywhere except Canada, you couldn't fail to notice that different countries have very different cultures.  Some hide their wealth; others literally worship a money god💰🧧.  Some work until they drop💪; others aren't even allowed to work more than 35 hours🦥.  You can't get anything done without bribery in some countries, including some developed ones 🇬🇷, but bribery is unthinkable in others.  Being 5 minutes late⌚ makes you irresponsibly rude in some countries, and an overbearing stickler in others.  And as our own Eduardo keeps emphasizing, in some countries, nobody takes anything seriously😜; in others, people kill each other over a 7th century political dispute☪️.



Do any of these cultural differences matter to national success?  Did the rich, well governed, transparent, stable countries get that way because of their culture, or does national success shape culture?  Come discuss on Saturday!  Our guest speaker researches this for a living, so she should have plenty of insights.



In the meanwhile, the paper by Guido Tabellini (attached) has some food for thought.  Let's read it before Saturday.  Abstract: "How and why does distant political and economic history shape the functioning of current institutions? This paper argues that individual values and convictions about the scope of application of norms of good conduct provide the 'missing link.' Evidence from a variety of sources points to two main findings. First, individual values consistent with generalized (as opposed to limited) morality are widespread in societies that were ruled by non-despotic political institutions in the distant past. Second, well-functioning institutions are often observed in countries or regions where individual values are consistent with generalized morality, and under different identifying assumptions this suggests a causal effect from values to institutional outcomes."



Cheers,

恭喜发财 \[literally: "I hope you get rich"],
