Some 8 thousand years ago, in (one of) [the cradle(s) of civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization#Mesopotamia), mankind first began reading, writing, creating laws and living under organized government. For the next several millennia, quite a few civilizations came and went, particularly in 1177BC, a collapse [which is wonderfully described in this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRcu-ysocX4), which took with it the [Sea Peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples). Eventually the [Abrahamic religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions) became a thing, and around 700 the Muslim branch took over the place. In 1639 the Ottoman Empire signed a treaty nominally taking over, but that doesn't mean there was a whole lot of peace and stability.



After world war I did away with most empires, the #bestempire took over management after the League of Nations awarded it a mandate to run the place, and in 1921 the [Kingdom of Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Iraq) was born, giving a new name to the better part of a region historically known as Mesopotamia. In 1932 the Kingdom of Iraq was granted independence, and, like [all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus) [trouble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia) [childs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan), [went](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi) [on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone) [to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe) [be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia) [a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar) [disappointment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).



Young independent Kingdom or Iraq proceeded to be immediately beset by an unending sequence of coups and coup attempts, to the point that in [1941 mother Britain had to step in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Iraqi_War) to keep the oil flowing. Britain kept military bases around until 1954, and when they withdrew guess what?\
\
In [1958 the Iraqi monarchy was overthrown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14_July_Revolution), a republic established, and the instability went on willy nilly, and in 1968 the Ba'ath Party took over in a coup, where [a young Saddam was not very instrumental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein). Nevertheless, Saddam quickly rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the party's strongman and culminating in a purge in 1979.



Even before that, signs of what was to come were clear. In 1976, [Jacques Chirac allowed France to sell a nuclear reactor to Iraq](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-08-26-mn-17874-story.html), which the [israelis managed to destroy in 1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Opera), in what became a long, protracted game of *don't let Saddam build the bomb.* Over the next decade, Saddam continued to try to get ahead on the game, the problem was, he had this narty habit of starting regional wars. So when he [invaded Kuwait in 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Kuwait) (after just getting off the hook from the [1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War)) that just...crossed a line, you know? (badum-tsss)



After Saddam refused to withdraw when the UN said pretty please, the US stepped in, with a coalition [authorized by the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_678). That was the [Gulf War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War), where the US effectively [bombed Iraq back to the stone age](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/16/world/us-weighs-the-value-of-bombing-to-coerce-iraq.html), but stopped short of regime change. Sigh.



What succeeded was that you had 23 million people starving in an oil rich country now devoid of basic infrastructure, and sanctioned so hard that it couldn't sell the oil to rebuild the economy (or, in reality, the military). What do you do when you have a petty dictator in charge who can't be at all trusted to do \*anything\* to alleviate the suffering of his people?\
\
Why not sell the oil on his behalf? And then only allow the proceeds to be used to buy food and medicine for the starving populace? Sounds like a good idea. But who should manage it? Hmm. Why not the UN? Who never did anything like this, let alone on this scale, at all? Yeah that should be fine.



And so the [Oil-for-Food Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil-for-Food_Programme) was born in 1995. The premise was exactly that, but the results were...far less than ideal. It's annual budget grew to be $10B a year, dwarfing the entirety of the rest of the UN which amounted to $2B. It grew extremely corrupt, running with virtually no oversight, thanks to a UN that was too inept and bureaucratic (to put it mildly) to actually manage anything.\

Last Saturday we watched the movie [Backstabbing for Beginners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstabbing_for_Beginners#:~:text=Backstabbing%20for%20Beginners%20is%20a,Theo%20James%20and%20Ben%20Kingsley.), which was inspired by the [book by the same name](http://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=65A84839F9E22DA0F0DD8445F2772A1E), written by a jovial turned disgruntled UN staffer Michael Soussan, whose career coincided with the majority of the program's duration. The movie in turn inspired me to read the book, which is really enthralling, full of sordid details and I highly recommend.



In the end, the only reason why *anything* came to light was because the US finally invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam in 2003 (big surprise: the nuclear inspections were actually effective) and ended up taking all the government's records and putting them in the UN, so when a big carefully curated list of everyone Saddam dealt with came to light, all that Kofi had to do was call an investigation and let them peruse the UN archives, which he eventually reluctantly [agreed to](https://web.archive.org/web/20111112084055/http://www.iic-offp.org/about.htm).



The result was so bombastic that it basically implicated the whole world, republicans and democrats alike, as well as all the other countries, and once the investigation ran out of money they didn't give it more to keep uncovering all the terrible things. In the end of the day not a lot of people were punished, but some reform, I'm told, happened.



So, come hangout with us in..2 hours, tonight at the usual time and the usual place: [https://caltech.zoom.‚Äãus/j/4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)



I'll tell you more than you care about the UN and the Oil-for-Food Programme!\

PS: This weekend we'll be watching the movie [Vice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(2018_film)), which, I'm told, "Americans hate because it reminds them of a bad time", so maybe now it will remind us of a *better* time!
