**SPECIAL: Tonight's meeting, officially unofficially starting at 5pm, in addition to the [usual zoom link](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668), will be held in the new exclusive sovclub gather virtual space. Check it out:** [https://gather.town/app/​elnWDMcafBNO0A7Y/sovclub](https://gather.town/app/elnWDMcafBNO0A7Y/sovclub)





**Kenny proposes:**

Idea for Xenocracy implementation: Debtor's Xenocracy (a.k.a. expanding venture capitol)

* Leaders Xenocratically chosen by companies that they're in debt to, so you only accept money/assistance from countries you trust.
* Xenocratic power distributed in proportion to debts and power can be redistributed by borrowing from other countries and paying off existing debts.
* Each loaning country must stay below a 50% controlling stake (otherwise it's soft annexation which can maybe be okay in this system?)
* Countries can either earn their way out of debt by raising their GDP and subsequently taxes or double down and embrace the bubble they're making.

Pros:

* Encourages foreign investment in financially impoverished countries.
* Countries aren't forced to give up control to political opponents.

Things to figure out:

* Should the Xenocratically elected leader of the debtor country have control over who they'll accept aid from and the proportions?
* What if no one else wants to let you borrow money? (We end up where we are today?)
* Keeping the debtor country intentionally impoverished so that the loaning countries can stay in control perpetually (resolved by reallocating debt?)
* Should regular venture capitalists and companies be able to buy controlling stakes in countries?

**Eduardo adds:**



\- Yes to VCs buying controlling stakes in countries. Even angel investors. That's what I've been training for my whole life. That's why I love this article\
- You can ALWAYS borrow money. Look at Argentina\
- I don't think any of the lenders will have too much trouble keeping the debtors in debt - they'll do a good job mismanaging their economy on their own already\
- The thing with the Xenocratically elected leaders is that it should primarily affect positions in charge of foreign policy. I can see presidential elections being Xenocratically decided. But for e.g. senators, governors and house members, there's also gonna be a lot of internal debt from the federal government and other states. Sames with cities. It's a fractal of Xenocracy.\
\
One thing that occurs to me is how the contracts are negotiated in terms of currency. Because if they are denominated in the local currency, you can always deliberately devalue it. But if its in a basket of international currencies, and you're incapable of controlling your currency inflation, you might be unfairly beholden to the debtors..which might be fine?



Join us in an hour to talk more about how Xenocracy can make the world a better place! Remember that [xenocracy.org](http://xenocracy.org/) ​has a built in blog, it will be easy to proselytize!



In sovereignty,\
