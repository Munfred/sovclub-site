Picture this. A land of plenty. Lush and tropical as far as the eye can see, going far beyond what the mind can grasp. A land of plenty where everything grows. Where crops are to be harvested twice a year. Where all is to be had, but it must be worked for. The natives are too content to build empires, living in a state of idle abundance with nothing to plunder. 



Settlers, coming almost as an afterthought from an aloof and far away metropolis, readily meld into this state of idle abundance. The few delusional visionaries and dreamers who dare devote themselves to a cause whose fruit they shall never see disappear into the vastness. To sow the seed of civilization in a virgin and untamed - but docile - land is something few can fathom, and even fewer endeavour on. Their cries - "men! more men!" go unheard and ignored by a metropolis that would much rather plunder a pittance than to sow an endless harvest. Centuries go by, the settlers but fleas in an elephant. They quietly multiply. 



In the grasslands cattle breeds so easily that ranching is made unnecessary by the hunting of wild herds. A gold rush causes the metropolis to finally take notice of this land of plenty, a handful of cities sprouting more than skin deep. The metropolis, as myopic as ever, only cares about squeezing wealth. They starve this land of plenty of any inkling of development beyond the bare minimum needed to assert control and extract wealth. What is development, anyway?



Then, an upheaval. Foreign invaders cause the rulers in the metropolis to uproot themselves and move to the land of plenty. More happens in two decades than in three centuries. For the first time culture is not strangled, and development is fostered. But what is development, anyway?



The invaders recede, the metropolis calls back the rulers. But having tasted development and self rule, the land of plenty would not have it differently. It breaks free to rule itself, however haphazardly. And so it does, for two centuries. Two centuries of haphazard direction that follow three centuries of people multiplying without aim.



The land of plenty was seeded with people and left to brew. It grew into a chaotic and impoverished mass of humans, sporting but a thin and heterogeneous crust of shakily established civilization. Devoid of history of any depth, their culture is a pliable, creative and syncretic mix of all that reaches the land of plenty. The land of plenty is festering with a mix of misery, wealth, and creation, all at once.
