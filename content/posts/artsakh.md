Tonight we will talk about the country of [Artsakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh), recognized by 3 non-UN members, and which has possibly the coolest country flag ever. 

This budding nation is at the root of a [new flaring war](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2020-10-01/why-armenia-and-azerbaijan-are-brink-war), another chapter the [Nagorno-Karabakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh) conflict. Since things started heating up two weeks ago then Armenia, Azerbaijan and Artsakh agreed on a [ceasefire](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54488386) a few days ago that [didn't last](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/14/923674768/azerbaijan-armenia-trade-accusations-of-breaking-cease-fire-in-nagorno-karabakh). Given [everyone says that they don't want war, just want their land back, but would rather die than not get their land back](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54522278), that's hardly surprising.
