I was born in 1992. A flower child of the Empire, I never knew the kind of deep running geopolitical instability that characterized all of the 20th century. Born in an age of unprecedented peace and stability, I was raised to think that ‚Äúofficial‚Äù country borders were immutable. In the entire 28 years I‚Äôve been around (my birthday was last week) I can only count 8 ‚Äúofficial‚Äù new countries. Contrast that with [137 in the 47 years between 1945 and 1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_date_of_formation#Sortable_list). That‚Äôs an average 2.91 vs 0.285 new countries per year. A ten fold change. [Let me plot that for you](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1teVx38IfjcPMwsiis8VA0D8rNO4gbDYe?usp=sharing). Certainly witnessing things rather than reading about them on the books or wikipedia affects your perception of the world.



And so it is that an entire generation or two of global flower children came to be. We were raised to think that nothing happens. We never knew [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genocides_by_death_toll). Except for [Bosnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_genocide), [Rwanda](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26875506), [Darfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur_genocide) and change. We never knew [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_war#Wars). Except for the ones listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars:_1990%E2%80%932002) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars:_2003%E2%80%93present). We never knew [direct attacks on the Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_attacks_on_U.S._territory), except for your standard fare of [domestic terrorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_the_United_States)...wait actually, neither did the people before us, which explains why the over-reaction to the foreign threat of the 02020-09-11 attacks.



And what an over-reaction. The [complete flouting of international law](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/16/iraq.iraq) by the [world‚Äôs police](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DBZftYyQV_uefwTMtvtHWTGIkwmSPkHzHdzft8mD3as/edit#slide=id.g743b4f3ab1_0_1616)! But what could we, flower children, do? Turn a blind eye, look the other way, and hope it wouldn‚Äôt happen [again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_war_crimes) [too much](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change). Yet...something changed. From the new [theater](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/01/tsa-business-security-theater-not-security/357599/) [department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security) to the [coddling of imperial citizens](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/), an observer might be able to make the case that the Empire of today was not the strong, buff Empire of yesterday.



But...nothing happened! No crises, except for [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_economic_crises) and [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_refugee_crises) and [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_crisis). But, you know, nothing terrible. And so, any possible assumptions about decreased buff-ness of the Empire went unchallenged by reality.



Until...now. Now, it seems, something is happening. For the most part, it‚Äôs a pandemic, which, when you put it in historical context, is not even terrible, [it‚Äôs only mildly bad](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-05-28/spanish-flu-didnt-wreck-global-economy). But somehow the Empire has been having a hard time coping. Add to that a healthy dollop of [civil unrest](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-05-28/spanish-flu-didnt-wreck-global-economy). Which, if you look at the list, is not even that bad, when you compare them with [this](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-05-28/spanish-flu-didnt-wreck-global-economy), [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_assassination_riots) or [this](https://www.npr.org/2017/04/26/524744989/when-la-erupted-in-anger-a-look-back-at-the-rodney-king-riots) and [especially this](https://status451.com/2017/01/20/days-of-rage/). So ordinarily one would just shrug it off and say ‚Äúlook at all the actual terrible things that happened, why would it be different this time?‚Äù.



Yet I can‚Äôt help but feel deep inside that this time it is different. Much like Singaporeans confidence in their British white masters was [shattered after the Japanese occupation](https://books.google.com.br/books?id=hBSyDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171&dq=singapore+confidence+in+the+british+shaken+after+japanese+occupation&source=bl&ots=n-L3kMmIx0&sig=ACfU3U0VkxWVIy1ymrE6TEfLoR_NXkv0uQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjKvOqLweTpAhUWIbkGHfQ-DWIQ6AEwCXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=singapore%20confidence%20in%20the%20british%20shaken%20after%20japanese%20occupation&f=false), so too has my confidence in the Empire been shaken after so many bumbling displays of incompetence. I hope I am wrong and that the decline is reversible, but I don‚Äôt think it is. Now that things are happening, I think they are going to keep happening.



What lies down the road? Our much esteemed [Kevin Rudd](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/authors/kevin-rudd) paints a [poignant scenario](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-05-06/coming-post-covid-anarchy). One where both the Empire and the Middle Kingdom will emerge from this crisis significantly diminished:



‚ÄúNeither a new Pax Sinica nor a renewed Pax Americana will rise from the ruins. Rather, both powers will be weakened, at home and abroad. And the result will be a continued slow but steady drift toward international anarchy across everything from international security to trade to pandemic management. With nobody directing traffic, various forms of rampant nationalism are taking the place of order and cooperation. The chaotic nature of national and global responses to the pandemic thus stands as a warning of what could come on an even broader scale.‚Äù



He concludes by listing a bunch of things that should happen but will not, and ends saying: ‚ÄúWith the wrong decisions, the 2020s will look like a mindless rerun of the 1930s; the right decisions, however, could pull us back from the abyss.‚Äù



I wasn‚Äôt too sure about what to expect. But now I [am](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1930s). Thanks Kevin!



See you tomorrow 6PM cartime at our usual link: [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/‚Äã4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)

PS: Our first sovwatch‚Ñ¢ was a great success. Surprisingly so. Like, people really liked it. Who‚Äôd have thought. So I would like to have another one this Saturday, at the same time, 5PM cartime. Do you have a movie you think we should watch?
