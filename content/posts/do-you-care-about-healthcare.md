As promised on Saturday, tomorrow we'll have a real discussion! (but rest assured that bullshit time will be allowed to proceed for up to 30 min). [Ollie](https://twitter.com/seismolliegist?lang=en) will tell us about the [Caltech grad student healthcare petition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oTYzasRVohAdBGmnjPoXJ0AO775XEk1emRagUJqS6H0/edit?usp=sharing) which was forwarded to the administration on Monday, and by the end of the meeting, if nobody complains, sovclub will add the prestige of it's name to the undersigned.

See you tomorrow
