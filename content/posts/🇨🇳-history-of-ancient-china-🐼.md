*"By nature, men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart."* -- Confucius

Greetings to all under Heaven, 

Have you ever wondered why China has such a big border wall? Or why Japan still uses so many Kanji? Or why China has so many people???

Possible answers to these questions, and the meaning of your existence in a society, will be covered this Wednesday, at 6 pm cartime. 

Austin Liu will present to us on the history of China (aka the Sick Man of Asia, Celestial Empire, Divine Realm, etc. etc.) starting from prehistory, and see how far we get. Hopefully we'll get at least to the Han Dynasty.
