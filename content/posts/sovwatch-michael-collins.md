Tonight we will watch a [1996 movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(film)) about [Michael Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(Irish_leader)), one of the leaders of the Irish struggle for independence. Boy, it really was a *struggle.* If you want to learn about precipitating factors for the Irish independence movement, check out [this 8 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT8uFIbNrHw), and if you want to learn how the civil war panned out, [watch this 14 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ8-2IMKezQ).

Spoilers: Collins was a fool and got himself shot dead, jeopardizing what little chance there was for mediation and an earlier cessation of conflicts. In the end history ran its course and thigns happened anyway, all this struggle was just that - a pointless struggle. \
