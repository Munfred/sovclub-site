*Tomorrow we shall congregate to hear about the plights and travails that the feds impose on the peoples of the world for the privilege of legally hanging out in America.*



Instead of meeting at BBB B101, we will go to the International Graduate Students Townhall at 6PM the CSS second floor.

**There will be food. [RSVP here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSew562k-SnQySSPqHmdteaZvROP_H--iUogrkhNBdgm5XVfcQ/viewform).**



I was told that the following topics will be discussed:

> *1. Financial assistance from Caltech*
>
> *2. Legal assistance from Caltech (on all immigration-related issues, irrespective of legal status and nationality)*
>
> *3. Official policy on working remotely while VISA is under inspection*
>
> *4. Resources from ISP and HR*
>
> *5. Housing access for early arrivals and OPT waiting period (post defense)*
>
> *6. General campus-wide awareness on VISA difficulties*
>
> *7. Tax documentation and filing assistance*





If that sounds important, or you are curious, or just hungry, come by. If not no hard feelings. We can still play Stickfight after 7:30, just let me know.
