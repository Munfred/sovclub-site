This Saturday at 10AM we will have **a super duper special event** with [Alex Hochuli](https://twitter.com/alex__1789), author of the American Affairs article...

*[The Bananification of the World](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2021/05/the-brazilianization-of-the-world/)*



> *The West’s involution finds its mirror image in the original coun­try of the future, the nation doomed forever to remain the country of the future, the one that never reaches its destination: Bananaland. The Bananification of the world is our encounter with a future denied, and in which this frustration has become constitutive of our social reality. While the closing of historical horizons has often been a leftist, indeed Marxist, concern, the sense that things don’t work as they should is now widely shared across the political spectrum. Welcome to Bananaland. Here the only people satisfied with their situation are financial elites and venal politicians. Everyone complains, but everyone shrugs their shoulders. This slow degradation of society is not so much a runaway train, but more of a jittery rollercoaster, occasionally holding out promise of ascent, yet never break­ing free from the tracks. We always come back to where we started, shaken and disoriented, haunted by what might have been…*



Such is how Alex [summarized the article](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/author/alex-hochuli/). You see, nothing new under the sun. We at sovclub have always been visionaries, and it is only fair that eventually the rest of the world catched up, recognizing our genius and prowess. Bananaland actually *is* the land of the future, [and has always been](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jMzChRfMDHmzOsAcbx-xWkCeiiBUT33-ssYqOlmRE0c/edit?usp=sharing). The complaints about it being a future that never arrived were indeed correct, they only missed the target. We had to wait for the *rest* of the world to catch up to Bananaland, for it was so far into the future.



Join us to chat with Alex Hochuli this saturday at 10AM PST to see what this future looks like  [https://caltech.zoom.us/​j/4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)



In Sovereignty,
