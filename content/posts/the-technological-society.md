¬† ¬† ¬† *What is modern life, and is it the machine or man who is the tool of the other?*



Answering these questions on the threshold of the Modern Age is [Jacques Ellul](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=488a5c8502&e=09f1ce99cf), a sociologist and Christian Anarchist. Ellul was born in Bordeaux, France, in 1912. In his formative years he became fascinated and then disillusioned with Marx, converted to Protestantism, and studied the history of law. He was active in the French Resistance during German occupation, and was honored as 'righteous among the nations' for his efforts to save Jews during the holocaust. After the war he Ellul taught the sociology of institutions at the University of Bordeaux, and published many books, including the [Technological Society](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=696cecba1d&e=09f1ce99cf) (1954), [Propaganda](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=a23ce18dc1&e=09f1ce99cf) (1962) and [The Political Illusion](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=0d917ed447&e=09f1ce99cf) (1965).



Ellul saw the mass movements of the modern world as a consequence of an activity he terms 'technique'. In his view, technique is a type of thinking that has emerged to dominate all human society and give rise to the phenomenon we call modernity.

Ellul writes; ‚ÄúTechnique, as I use it, does not mean machines, technology, or this or that procedure for attaining an end" rather, it is ‚Äúthe totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency in every field of human activity. It is the systematic application of rationalized objective thinking to all spheres of human life, and it is the social condition within which we live.



¬† ¬† ¬† Emerging from the confluence of technical thinking and behavior are institutions and infrastructure that form a vast machine, aligned towards its own ends, and ‚Äúrepresenting the ideal toward which technique strives.‚Äù This machine has created the modern, industrial world, conforming the human condition to its own purpose, obliterating tradition and domesticating human beings in service of infinite growth. It is the mechanized organism that has replaced god as the object of worship in the modern world. Utilitarians of all types; economists, managers, industrialists, politicians, scientists, technicians, propagandists and progressives of all types are joined in unwitting religious worship of a being we cannot control, insisting that improvements in material conditions are an absolute justification for the imposition of artificiality, the destruction of nature, and the degradation of the spiritual condition of mankind. As Ellul puts it; ‚ÄúAll-embracing technique is in fact the consciousness of the mechanized world.‚Äù



*Eduardo:*



Most of us will never get around to reading Elluls 400-page 1954 treatise, The Technological Society (I am trying to, and likely to never finish it). What we all can do however, and which I highly recommend, is to read the 10-page [Translators Introduction to the 1964 English Edition](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=842358bc5d&e=09f1ce99cf). That will save you the troubles of reading much of the book.



To whet your appetite, wanted to share some of my favorite snippets ¬†with some commentary reactions (as annotated in the paper copy James gave me years ago I only started reading last week).



*The technological malaise seems to Have been much less acutely felt in the United States. Individuals such as **Aldous Huxley, Paul Tillich, and Erich Fromm**, who have raised their voices in protest, are of European origin and received their education in Europe. Technolaters such as Professors **B. F. Skinne**r of Harvard and most other American professors represent the familiar type of the American intellectual caught in an ecstatic technical vertigo and seldom proceeding beyond certain vague meditations on isolated problem areas such as the ‚Äúpopulation explosion,‚Äù if indeed he considers the real problems posed by technology at all. **Ellul holds the Americans to be the most conformist people in the world**, but in fairness it must be objected that, in his own analysis, the Soviets seem better to deserve this dubious honor since they have made even politics into a technique. The Americans, apart from technicizing the electoral process, have left at least the sphere of politics to the operations of amateurish bunglers and have thereby preserved a modicum of humanity.*

\[‚Ä¶]

*Ellul could not mean to assert that men in the past have not had to contend with material means which threatened to exceed their capacity to make good use of them, but that men in the past were not confronted with technical means of production and organization which in their sheer numerical proliferation and velocity unavoidably **surpassed man‚Äôs relatively unchanging biological and spiritual capacities to exploit them as means to human ends.***

\[‚Ä¶]

*It is in fact, the essence of technique to compel the qualitative to become quantitative, and in this way to force every stage of human activity and man himself to submit to its mathematical calculations.*

\[A challenge for us inclined to mathematical calculations: just like in physics what gives meaning to the math are the units, could we not do a better job of preserving meaning in the realm of technique? ¬†Could we devise a human-first analogue of our current machine-first technique? Can we have a mathematics of meaning, with which we can adroitly manipulate the essential elements of human existence without resorting to crass reductionism that eschews meaning, the same way we currently can manipulate the essential elements of technical systems?]



*It should not be imagined, however, that the universal concentration camp which Ellul thinks is coming into being in all technical societies without exception will be felt as harsh or restrictive by its inmates. Hitler‚Äôs concentration camps of hobnailed boots were symptoms of a deficient political technique. **The denizen of the technological state of the future will have everything his heart ever desired, except, of course, his freedom.** [[As Huxley pointed out](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=4e7108b04f&e=09f1ce99cf)]. Admittedly, modem man, forced by technique to become in reality and without residue the imaginary producer-consumer of the classical economists, shows disconcertingly little regard for his lost freedom; but, according to Ellul, **there are ominous signs that human spontaneity, which in the rational and ordered technical society has no expression except madness, is only too capable of outbreaks of irrational suicidal destructiveness.***

[[Ted?](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=ac4867a32e&e=09f1ce99cf)]



*The escape valves of modem literature and art, which technique has contrived, may or may not turn out to be adequate to the harmless release of the pent-up ‚Äúecstatic‚Äù energies of the human bang. **Technique, which can in principle only oppose technical and quantitative solutions to technical problems, must, in such a case, seek out other technical safety valves. It could, for example, convince men that they were happy and contented by means of drugs, even though they were visibly suffering from the worst kind of spiritual and material privation.***

[As [remarked in the critical introduction of the second edition of Fromm's ‚ÄúThe Sane Society‚Äù](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=bee6457192&e=09f1ce99cf), written in 1965, 10ish years after the Technological society; which grapples with much the same ailments from a different angle:\
*As we have already commented, Fromm is first and foremost a moralist: and, typically for his age, he casts his moralizing within a psychological discourse. But the big difference between him and the run-of-the-mill psychologist is that the latter moralizes without admitting it, and without straying from a banal and socially uncritical standpoint. **That psychologists are the priests of the twentieth century is not simply a cliche, but a literal truth;** however much the language differs, there is a great deal of continuity between the tasks of the modern "caretaker of souls" and those of his priestly counterpart.' One crucial difference, however, is that while the most complacent of ecclesiastical bureaucrats is obliged by the rules of the Church to take time off for meditation and reflection, no comparable obligation exists for psychologists. Fromm is an example of an increasingly scarce breed: a psychologist who wants to say something important about human life, and is willing to study beyond the limits of his discipline in order to get it right.]*

\
***Since men are unwilling to acknowledge their demotion to die status of joyous robots,** and since they demand justification for their individual and collective acts as never before in history, it is easy to understand why the modern intellectuals (and their forcinghouse, the university) have become veritable machines for the invention of new myths and the propagation of old ones. It would be easy to compile a list of all the things which Ellul must deem ‚Äúmyth.‚Äù Such a list would quite simply contain all philosophical, historical, religious, and political doctrines known to man, except insofar as such doctrines have technological components. The Western democracies, for example, are out after money and the Eastern Communists are out after power; otherwise they share an identical view of life, and the epiphenomenal variant ideologies which accompany identical acts can only be described as a cruel hoax.*

\[Ouch?]



It is disconcerting in the extreme to contemplate the possibility that cherished democratic institutions have become empty forms which have no visible connection with the acts of democratic nations, except perhaps to render these acts technically less efficient than they otherwise need have been. But the fact that they have no connection is, paradoxically, a powerful reason for their survival. **Ellul evidently contemplates a long future in which sclerotic rival ideologies will carry on their sham polemics.**

[Be sure to ask Dylan about [\*ops](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=c5427fee34&e=09f1ce99cf)]



Ellul, in agreement with much of Creek philosophy, seems to think that the distinction usually drawn between thought and action is a pernicious one. **To him, to bear witness to the fact of the technological society is the most revolutionary of all possible acts.**

[I'm with Ellul partway, but would like to propose an addendum: that after realizing it and bearing witness to it, we actually do something about it. Ellul, as [you will see in pages xxx and xxxi in his preface to the Revised American Edition](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=38fcdcb582&e=09f1ce99cf): *‚ÄúThe reader may be pessimistic on yet another score. In this study no solution is put forward to the problems raised. Questions are asked, but not answered. I have indeed deliberately refrained from providing solutions.‚Äù.* Ellul is not one to propose a whole lot of solutions, he fancies himself more of a ‚Äúsociologist‚Äù, which I understood to be like a physicist, but for people things, and as such, he's not so eager to actually meddle with the systems he observes and describes, he seems to just want figure out what is going on and point it out]



*It is clear that many people who will accept Elluls diagnosis of the technical disease will not accept his Christian therapy. **The issue is nevertheless joined: if massive technological intervention is the only imaginable means to turn aside technology from its headlong career, how may we be sure that this intervention will be something other than just some new technical scheme, which, more likely than not, will be catastrophic?***



That's how the Translator's introduction ends. At this point, I have one call to action (or to reflection): **it is up to us, technologists, to conceive and bring about these new human and technical schemes and arrangements. Nobody else will.** Because, as we have been learning time and time again, the people most equipped to think about society are least equipped to think and deal with technology. We need a new breed of intellectual, the humanist technologists, that can successfully, deeply and meaningfully navigate the human and technical world. I have been reaching the sad conclusion that such new breed will not spontaneously emerge from the humanities to cross over to the technical side, and that we, scientifically and technically trained people, are on a better footing and position to kickstart bringing about a new synthesis, and have our humanities friends join us in this ambitious endeavor.



Join us for a fascinating discussion on this fun and lighthearted topic! ![üòä](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f60a/72.png)
