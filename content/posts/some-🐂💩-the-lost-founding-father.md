Monkeys somehow evolved the ability and need to have imaginary friends. If your imaginary friend is only your own, other monkeys label you psychotic or schizophrenic. However if your imaginary friend is shared among other monkeys and y'all set to establish rules about that friend and your personal and collective relationship with him, you are good. Monkeys named that religion. If your religion grows, you eventually have political influence and then power. 



Eventually monkeys focus too much on power and control and other monkeys feel left out, so they rebelliously suggest changes and improvements to the rules and relationships. Some of them go poorly, some of them go very well. To the point of founding the ethos of the current decaying ruler of the world .

So, on this Wednesday, yours only, Brener, will introduce to you the American founding father that preceded the foundation of the first american colony by 60 years and we will discuss how this rebellious kraut led to the American revolution and general ethos which peaked at the evangelical great wakening that gift us the the best american religion of all - the Mormons.

See you tonight at 6PM: [https://caltech.zoom.us/​my/sovcall](https://caltech.zoom.us/my/sovcall)

In sovereignty,



Brener
