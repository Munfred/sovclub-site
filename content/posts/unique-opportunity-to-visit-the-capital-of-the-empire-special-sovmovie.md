If you ever wanted to know how the free world is run, this is your chance. I've just been informed by my underground network that **the Caltech Y still has spots available for their trip to the capital of the Empire happening on December 15-19**. You'll have the unique opportunity to talk with the leaders and lobbyists of the free world, as well as to witness it's capital (which has some great museums) before the Empire's fall. For more information and to sign up, see [here](https://www.caltechy.org/washington-dc-science-policy).\

On other news, we'll have **a special event at Sovereignty Lounge BBB B101 tomorrow, 7:30PM:** We'll be screening the movie [The Dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dictator_(2012_film)) (from 2012, not to be confused with [The *Great* Dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Dictator), from 1940).\

***Spoiler:*** If you have sensitivities, this movie will offend them



And next Wednesday during our regular meeting we'll actually have a \*special join meeting\* with the [Open Technology Club](https://www.opentechnology.club/). They vowed never to *[turn into another venue for airing over-informed political rants](https://caltechsovereignty.club/)*, but guess who's laughing last? We'll be discussing the regulation of technology, motivated by the fact that the US senate has in recent months introduced \*several\* tech regulation bills. [I've actually read them and wrote a summary of each](https://docs.google.com/document/d/193zSLS_q3l3uAUtu2-RGpohVdzor2ramfbs70KmZ2QI/edit?usp=sharing), and I encourage you to take a look at the original text (they're actually surprisingly short and readable). We'll also follow up with a long email rant on technology and regulation, don't worry. I just wanted to put this out there since I had the chance.\

Cheers\
