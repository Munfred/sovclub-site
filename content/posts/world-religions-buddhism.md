Founded in India in the middle of the first millennium BC, Buddhism is currently the world’s fourth largest religion, counting 0.5 billion believers. In this latest installment of our World Religions series, Rev. Gregory Gibbs from the Pasadena Buddhist Temple will tell us about Buddhism: its beliefs, its rituals, and its history. Topics will include the Buddha’s Awakening; the emergence of monasticism; the teaching of gender equality; inequality for nuns; the Mahayana (“Everybody included on the Large Vehicle”); the 8-fold-path/6 virtues; and the arrival of Buddhism to America.

People of all religious views are welcome to this discussion. Bring your challenging questions! Don't agree just to be agreeable, or criticize just to be critical.
