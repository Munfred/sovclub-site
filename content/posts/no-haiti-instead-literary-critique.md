Since Michael had to postpone his N-part-series on Haiti, I'm gonna take the opportunity for turning tomorrow's meeting into a literary critique meeting.



I have [been writing an article](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FMDauvUlMtSp_BdNPG6y8vn98qNhAtg7IlOB_jw-n8I/edit?usp=sharing) for the student views section of the [Harvard Banana Review,](https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/) and while it is not done, it is 70% of the way there, so perhaps you might want to pitch in.



So yeah, feel free to leave your comments on this google doc, or come tell me in person (in Zoom?) tomorrow at 6PM at [https://caltech.zoom.us/my/​sovcall](https://caltech.zoom.us/my/sovcall) about how I am bad at words.
