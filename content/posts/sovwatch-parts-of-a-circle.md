Way back on wednesday I mentioned we had a [new budding war](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2020-10-01/why-armenia-and-azerbaijan-are-brink-war), or rather just another chapter, of the [Nagorno-Karabakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh) conflict. Since then Armeni, Azerbaijan and Artsakh agreed on a [ceasefire](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54488386) that probably won't last.

I told you I had been looking for some movie or documentary about it, and finally found one! It is called *Parts of a Circle: History of the Karabakh Conflict*, and it's a four or five part series of an hour each. But it turns out that each [side of the conflict is so extremely bitter that the filmmakers did not publicly release the full thing](https://eurasianet.org/joint-armenian-azerbaijani-documentary-on-karabakh-released), even though it's been for release since 2016. Lucky for us, they did something even better: released a one hourish "summary" on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/407942633). So that's what we'll be watching tonight!



And then on wednesday we'll be talking about [Artsakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh), which has possibly the coolest country flag ever.



See you tonight at 5PM cartime on zoom at [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)
