We all have our shortlist of world leaders that we look up to and like to point on as an example of effective responsible global stewardship (you do too, right? Right??).



This month one such leader that figures on my list is stepping down: Angela Merkel. In my opinion she is particularly interesting because she's the only world leader in recent memory that I know of that has a PhD in the hard sciences: quantum chemistry. She had several published articles prior to entering politics. [Check](http://cccc.uochb.cas.cz/53/10/2191/). [This](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0301010488871064). [Out](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00233a012?casa_token=Iml0SLEIKvQAAAAA:tiRS7LWoDqK_lOG84pRkurymJ8svEWOQDrqGMyaF2f1cXuQO5nI5nJFndNQtbRbZrwKl-YbxYmWCgJkI).



To my chagrin I still haven't gotten around to reading her biography or anything, but she's stepping down this month, and since Austin has to postpone his presentation on the Celestial Empire yet again I thought we could read some articles and talk about Merkel. There has been a number of Merkel review articles coming our as a result of the end of her term, so that's handy. Here they are:



* [This one from Foreign Affairs is pretty good, also attaching as PDF](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2021-04-20/angela-merkel-singular-chancellor)
* [Fun short article from Foreign Policy about Merkel's pessimism for the future of the free world and how that informs the relationship with China](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FMDauvUlMtSp_BdNPG6y8vn98qNhAtg7IlOB_jw-n8I/edit?usp=sharing)



So, come today at 6PM to [https://caltech.zoom.us/my/​sovcall](https://caltech.zoom.us/my/sovcall) to talk about..the future of the free world I guess. Also, Michal informs me that Canadian prime minister debate is going to be happening from 5pm to 7pm in ..*French*, so we might tune in that a bit for fun.



Cheers
