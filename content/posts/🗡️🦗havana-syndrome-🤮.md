Is it a cricket? A hallucination? A secret “directed energy weapon”? Whatever the source, in 2016, Canadian and American embassy staff in Havana first reported hearing such strange sounds, followed by a variety of concussion-like cognitive symptoms. Since then, similar phenomena — now dubbed “Havana Syndrome” — have been reported by government staff in a variety of locations from Vietnam to Germany. No weapon has been found and no mechanism has been proven, but speculations have ranged from sonic and chemical weapons to mass hysteria. Many have since come to suspect pulsed microwave weapons, which can generate audible acoustic responses in the head. Have we now found the smoking ray gun in this mystery? This week, we’ll look at these cases together, examine the proposed causes, and discuss the political motivations and implications behind such a “weapon”. 

Our speaker, David Garrett, happens to be working on a form of medical imaging which uses pulsed microwaves similar those suspected in this “attack.” A high-power pulsed microwave source (similar to those in radar systems) is used to briefly heat tissues, and through thermoelastic expansion generates detectable acoustic responses used to recover absorption profiles in the body. Before imaging patients, it is important to ensure that this system is safe for human use, requiring a close and careful assessment of microwave exposure standards. Are there unknown effects other than simply heating tissues? Would you willfully volunteer as an imaging subject?
