# Sovereignty Club, Episode XXXVIII.4 *: The Return of the Raj

*([please listen to this while reading this email](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D0ZQPqeJkk))*

Not too long ago, in a subcontinent far far away from the American consciousness...

The empire was in turmoil. After suffering a crippling victory in the western front, it was no longer able to keep the eastern dominions off the hands of [non-violent rebels](https://theconversation.com/the-forgotten-violence-that-helped-india-break-free-from-colonial-rule-57904). What was to become 537 (or so) countries, became [Ã∂ Ã∂oÃ∂nÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂tÃ∂wÃ∂oÃ∂](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India) [three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War).

[Muslims to one side, Hindus et al to another](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-nation_theory). Except for the Muslim majority [princely state of Jammu and Kashmir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(princely_state)), which chose to remain independent. Until two months later when attacks from West Pakistan spooked the Hindu Maharaja into unconditionally joining India, which, due to the [endownment effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect), is incapable of letting go. Pakistan, [despite not being able to keep itself together](http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1844754,00.html), also can't let go. T[he fun continues to this day, with China joining in on occasion for good measure.](https://www.newsweek.com/china-pakistan-warn-india-border-1452896)

Last week the [ball was on India's court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts), and they did not disapoint, [unilaterally revoking special autonomy to the princely state, cutting internet and telephone, and basically declaring martial law](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-jammu.html). Now it's Pakistan turn to make faces, support [Ã∂tÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂rÃ∂oÃ∂rÃ∂iÃ∂sÃ∂tÃ∂ Ã∂ political](https://intpolicydigest.org/2019/03/02/on-pakistan-s-role-in-encouraging-terrorism/) groups, and [casually namedrop first strike use of nuclear weapons](https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/Pakistans_Nuclear_Posture_policy_brief.pdf).

What will happen? Civil war? Nuclear war? All of the above? Maybe! Who knows!\
\
In order to help us make sense of all the geopolitical complexities of nuclear powers throwing tantums, our very own Raj has recently risen from the ashes (or cometh back from a several week long thing on quantum computing)! Join us at 6pm on Sovereignty Lounge, BBB B101 for this unique opportunity!
