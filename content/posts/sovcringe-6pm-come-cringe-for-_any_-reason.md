Something is happening, and it seems people are anxious and in need of cringing, for [reasons unclear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cylm92TKNY&feature=youtu.be). So we created an impromptu virtual safespace which you can join starting at 6PM cartime (7PM mapleoiltime, 9PM puritan time, 11PM bananatime).\

Come cringe for any reason, let those feelings out, we will let ours back at you:\

PS: Since 2019 trumponaro declared banaland wouldn't do bananalightsavingstime anymore (👍). But other countries are not so enlightened (you get the pun?). So the gap between bananatime and cartime is now 5 hours, putting the sacred time of 6PM cartime at 11PM bananatime. Given the propensity of our meetings to run...forever, I would like to get bullshit time started at 5PM cartime instead of 6PM. That poses a conundrum in more than one way: not only does Michael with his unabatable work ethic not stop working before 6PM, but [our constitution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2KZgRUbrxrfKcA5IiHkxdEK2Oe729vmSVcqMzSMovs/edit?usp=sharing) makes it very clear (Article 6., Section Bullshit) that by definition bullshit cannot take place before 6PM. So to formally keep the bullshit we'd need a constitutional amendment, which by definition can only be voted on after bullshit but before 7PM cartime. Also, I saw that Austin proposed a bunch of constitutional amendments, which should be voted on. More worringly, since the forums went down and I updated the website, I realize we now have a constitutional crisis (exciting!) because we \_can't vote\_. So it's time we update sovclub constitution v19.09.19 to something more...current. 



PSS: I googled "cringe emoji" and got this jewel. It feels very appropriate:
