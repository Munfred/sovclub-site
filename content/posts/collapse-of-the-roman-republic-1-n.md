*This was the beginning in Rome of civil bloodshed, and of the licence of the sword. From this time on right was crushed by might, the most powerful now took precedence in the state, the disputes of the citizens which were once healed by amicable agreements were now settled by arms, and wars were now begun not for good cause but for what profit there was in them. Nor is this to be wondered at; for precedents do not stop where they begin, but, however narrow the path upon which they enter, they create for themselves a highway whereon they may wander with the utmost latitude; and when once the path of right is abandoned, men are hurried into wrong in headlong haste, nor does anyone think a course is base for himself which has proven profitable to others.‚Äù ‚Äì Velleius Paterculus, Roman historian, c. 20 AD*



Before the United States existed, the Roman Republic was the most famous and most successful republic in history. At its founding in 509 BC, it was the government of a city state that barely controlled several square miles of territory. Over the next 400 years, the republic‚Äôs hard work, martial valor, and wise foreign policies led it to defeat all its enemies to become the sole superpower of the Mediterranean, controlling a vast empire spanning Spain to Syria. Every year magistrates were elected; the winners governed, the losers accepted defeat, and peaceful electoral politics continued‚Äîa stability unheard of in an ancient world full of usurpers, palace coups, poisonings, and civil wars.



By 133 BC, things had started to go wrong. Populist and conservative politicians started to outdo each other in ignoring the unspoken norms (mos maiorum) that bound the state together. The battle of words quickly turned violent; mob intimidation turned to murder, murder turned into civil war. The disastrous final century of the republic ended with the state securely in the hands of one man‚ÄîAugustus Caesar‚Äîa king in all but name. Rome would be ruled by emperors for the next 1500 years of its history.



I‚Äôll talk about how the collapse of the republic unfolded, and the economic, military, and demographic factors underlying it. As much as possible, I quote from ancient historians to let them speak for themselves. What lessons you draw from it is up to you.
