With few exceptions, the world doesn't make new countries anymore.Â  What's an aspiring utopian to do?Â  One idea is to convince an existing country that you'll make moneyğŸ’¸ rain from the skies if they let you build a "charterÂ city" in their territory and run it as you will.Â  Think China and Hong Kong.Â Â [Here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/prospectus-on-prospera "https\://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/prospectus-on-prospera")Â is an exceptionally detailed article I stumbled upon about one aspiringÂ charterÂ city, which is currently a 58 acre piece of uninhabited land in Honduras.[](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/prospectus-on-prospera)



Mark Lutter is the founder ofÂ [CharterÂ CitiesÂ Institute](https://www.chartercitiesinstitute.org/about "https\://www.chartercitiesinstitute.org/about"), "a nonprofit dedicated to building the ecosystem forÂ charterÂ cities", because "a fresh approach was necessary to tackle humanityâ€™s most pressing challenges: global poverty, rapid urbanization, and conflict and migration caused by poverty, war, and climate change".Â  Â AreÂ charterÂ citiesÂ the best thing since sliced bread, or the worst thing since the coronavirus?Â  Bring your thoughts and come join Mark Lutter to discuss.
