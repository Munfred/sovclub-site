It is fair to say that \_everyone\_ thinks there is something wrong with the west, it is only that nobody can quite agree on what it is, or put their fingers on it and decide what to do about it.



Over 40 years ago, BF Skinner too thought there was something deeply wrong with the west,and he wrote an essay about it, and published it in his 1987 book *Upon Further Reflection.* If you don't want to read the entire chapter 2 (attached), I copy below the section where he summarizes his diagnosis. For a solution though, you will need to read the entire chapter, or come to sovcall tonight at 6PM: [https://caltech.zoom.us/​my/sovcall](https://caltech.zoom.us/my/sovcall)



*Here, then, are five kinds of cultural practices that have eroded the contingencies of reinforcement under which the process of operant conditioning must have evolved:*



 * 1. People work for wages, but most of what they produce does not directly reinforce their behavior. The group profits from a division of labor and from specialization, but workers are alienated from the product of their work. Employers must invoke aver-sive sanctions.*

*\
2. People pay others to produce the things they consume, and thus avoid the aversive side of work, but they lose the reinforcing side as well. So do those who are helped by others when they could help themselves.*

*\
3. People do many things simply on advice, but only because rein- forcing consequences have followed when they have taken other kinds of advice. They avoid the cost of exploring new contingencies but miss the reinforcers that would have followed if they had not done so.*

*\
4. By observing rules and obeying laws, people avoid punishment, either by their acquaintances or by a government or religion. The personal consequences that "justify" the rules or laws are indirect and usually long deferred.*

*\
5. People look at beautiful things, listen to beautiful music, and watch exciting entertainments, but the only behaviors reinforced are looking, listening, and watching. When people gamble, they do a very few things a very large number of times, and eventually without gain.*



*We might put the result very generally in this way: Where thousands of millions of people in other parts of the world cannot do many of the things they want to do, hundreds of millions in the West do not want to do many of the things they can do. In winning the struggle for freedom and the pursuit of happiness, the West has lost its inclination to act.*



*A conclusion of that sort is too sweeping to be accurate, however, and it does not suggest a solution to our problem. A more detailed analysis is needed, and it must start a long way back.* \[...and it goes on for another few pages.]
