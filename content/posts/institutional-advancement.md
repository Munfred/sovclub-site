TLDR: I found the best investment opportunity I have ever seen across all of bananaland. Better than real banana estate, better than buying USD (in bananaland there are two certainties: death and inflation), better than [Petrobras](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PBR/) (haha jk anything is better than Petrobras), better than shoring/longing/buying/‚Äãselling/doing any derivative of GameStop (because you can‚Äôt trade GameStop in bananas!). What could it be? Well, read on.

Let‚Äôs say you got a good thing going, you know, an objectively good thing going, which means a public goods thing, which everyone agrees is good, because they feel good about it. Think: open source software, creating knowledge and making it freely available, giving poor kids a solid education so they can enter the (legal) job market and and make a living for themselves and their families instead of selling drugs doing violence/getting pregnant at 14/being homeless and depreciating your real estate value/generally creating all those societal burdens that misery brings about.¬†

There is only one problem: public goods are generally not aligned with ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äùas we generally think of it because capitalism relies on selling scarce goods, and public goods are not scarce, so in order to sell your public goods you‚Äôd need to fence them off and charge for them (oh hello there intellectual property...). There is also a misalignment there because it might as well be that those that benefit the most from your public goods (i.e. for whom is creates the most utility, is the most valuable, increases GDP the most) might not be able to pay much for them, sometimes not even how much they cost.

How do we fix that? How do we realign public goods with capitalism? I am eager to hear about all your game-theoretic answers about how blockchain with smart contracts is the solution. But today I‚Äôm [sorry-not-sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MsvER1dpjM) to present you with a much more boring, true and time tested solution that might be so commonplace and obvious as to be consistently overlooked. Are you ready? The solution is‚Ä¶

**Endowments.**

Yeah. I know. The solution to open source software has been staring you in the face (since you know, Caltech and every other university lives off one) all this time. Get a big pile of money, invest it smartly, use the proceeds to fund your public goods.¬†

There is only one problem: How do you get said big pile of money in the first place? The answer, good for us, has also already been figured out and perfect by universities. And it is...drumroll please...

 **Institutional Advancement.**¬†

By definition, institutional advancement (embracing alumni relations, fund raising, public relations, internal and external communications, and government relations) refers to a total program to foster understanding and support for a college or university ([Muller 1977](https://scihub.wikicn.top/10.1002/aehe.3640100203)).¬†

The answer to getting a big pile of money is, convince people to give you money! Wondrous! Perfect! Truly flawless.

How to convince people to give you money you might ask? The answer I think, lies in feelings. Let me tell you a story about feelings, and how they get people to do things.¬†

As you probably know by now, I have spent the better part of the pandemic in a tropical island, by the beach, surrounded by nature, without pressing things to worry about other than running out of [carambolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carambola) and having to make another run to the farmers market.

This setting provided me with ample opportunity for reflection. Every day, as I walked on the semi-deserted beach, I would think about how the world is unfair. About my poor friends and the rest of America, watching much of their country burn often in literal ways, while dealing with crippling anxiety courtesy of the American psyche and unrelenting news cycle and a deluge of political events everywhere.¬†

But I also thought about my fellow banana-mxn, for whom the pandemic and economic stuttering literally meant starvation, forced to live in favelas, often without hygiene, running water, deprived of a modicum of opportunity. Meanwhile here I was spending perhaps a fifth of my stipend to live gloriously on the beach working remote. The world is very unfair, indeed.

And you know what? It bothered me. It is easy to ignore all the terrible things with the world when they are happening in another country, in far away lands that you only hear about if you bother to read things and dig up the right sources. But in bananaland (much like in LA) inequality hits you in the face, constantly. You can‚Äôt stop by the traffic lights without someone coming by trying to sell you something for a few bananas so that they might be able to not starve that day. You hear about acquaintances who can‚Äôt pay the rent for that month (in a palace where rent is about 600 bananas,¬† about 110ish USD). That bothers you.

It bothered me so much that one night while sipping cacha√ßa a vision came to me, and I decided to call the state government social assistance secretariat and tell them I wanted to give a 400 banana UBI for 10 families of their choice for 6 months. The answer from their side(over many calls) went something like ‚ÄúWhat? Uhh. What? Uhh ok. Let me send you to the director‚Äù <after much calling> ‚ÄúYou know what you‚Äôd like to do is laudable but we are the government and there is so much red tape and bureaucracy everywhere that we can‚Äôt help you with this not in a million years. Here is a CSV with all the nonprofits in the state. Good luck bye‚Äù

Welcome to bananaland.¬†

And, believe it or not, I kinda got busy with actual work (and running on the beach) that I didn‚Äôt diligently scour the CSV file. But my mind was set to act. (should it not require strenuous effort from my part, naturally). And so eventually I did bump into the right investment opportunity, the one alluded to in the TLDR (yeah I know it was clickbait). Here‚Äôs the deal.

As you know I'm from Florian√≥polis, a nice beautiful island city in the coast of Brazil, and this being Brazil (even if one of the nicest cities), there is a terrifying amount of poverty, inequality, violence and all the bad things that stem from a lack of opportunity in life. This is concentrated along the favelas (shanty towns, primarily in the hills, but which still pale in comparison the ones in Rio)

There is a priest, in Florian√≥polis, Father Vilson Groh, who has been doing social work in the city over the last 42 years, he is now 62 and going strong! He did so much work, so many initiatives in parallel, that 10 years ago they merged into a "network" of 7 underlying organizations (the website is <https://www.redeivg.org.br/>, it's all in Portuguese, but google translate works pretty well). (Before you ask: the fact I endorse Father Vilson Groh and what he is doing should not be construed as an endorsement of [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God))

I visited the Vilson Groh Institute on monday and chatter with their executive director and was taken aback at the breadth of their actions on everything. Me my mom and my sister are trying to sell a house (bananahouse, for those in the know) where I grey up for 2.2M bananas (like literally, a banana on trader joe's is $0.19 and that's the conversion rate from real, BRL to USD). I don't need that money, so I kinda had made my mind I wanted to give them a sizeable chunk of the money I get form the sale of the house (which is split between me, my sister and my mom).¬†

I was so shocked at how spot on all of their projects and initiatives were, and how much they align with my values, that at the end of my conversation with their executive director I decided to give them 10800 bananas, enough for 6 scholarships over 9 months of 200 bananas for students that participate in a new program they are developing for inserting marginalized youth into the IT job market, and as a signal I was serious about it (in Brazil it is all too common to say a million things and do zero). The new program is called ‚ÄúPode Crer‚Äù(‚ÄúCan Believe‚Äù in a literal translation). [Here's a (pretty good) google translation](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=pt&tl=en&u=https://www.redeivg.org.br/noticias/ivg-abre-inscricoes-para-projeto-caixa-tem-programa-pode-crer/) of the announcement page describing the Can Believe program.

The Vilson Groh Institute has an astounding reach, and a number of initiatives that they have been running for decades, as well as newer ones. Their programs encompass everything from 0 to 24 years of age as they put it: from feeding people, to getting them scholarships, running kindergartens, running cultural and educational programs, and more recently an ambitious well organized program to provide technical training to young people in these marginalized communities so they can join the many tech companies that are spawning and growing in Florian√≥polis. With all this work going back decades and showing incredible results, they also have an incredible network of hundreds of volunteers

Everything they do screams SOCIAL JUSTICE in all caps in the best possible sense of the word. You know I don‚Äôt use that word lightly, but what they do is the embodiment of what that word should convey.

What they don't have, not nearly as much as they could use, is money. Brazil is an incredibly bureaucratic country and rather than incentivizing, the government effectively slows down any such independent social initiatives. In the US you can get a 50% tax deduction from donations to a range of qualified entities, in Brazil that is only about 8%, and only when there are specific government sanctioned projects happening, which the government always takes forever to approve if at all.¬†

They rely primarily on donations from private individuals and on voluntary work, which they get a lot of. But they have far more capacity to implement good projects than they have resources at hand. I'm now thinking about the following: how does institutional advancement works in the US, in practice? What are the things that move people and companies to make donations to causes and institutions?¬†

I know much of this knowledge is US-specific due to cultural and economic factors. Brazil does not have a strong philanthropy tradicion, and what little exists gets strangled by government bureaucracy. The folks at the Vilson Groh Institute are among a handful of nonprofits in Brazil that have such scale, breadth and time honed experience, but much of their know how in the institutional advancement side of things is incipient, and could benefit tremendously from the distilled experiences of other countries, especially the US. My desire is to understand what are the gaps between what they do and what US nonprofits do with regards to institutional advancement, and get them thinking about adopting certain practices that may be commonplace in US nonprofits and which could also make a big difference for Brazilian ones.¬†

So yeah. I knew you wouldn‚Äôt read all the way so I just wrote down a thoughtstream.¬†
