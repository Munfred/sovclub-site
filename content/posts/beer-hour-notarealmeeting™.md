In these trying times, do you ever wish you could sit back, relax, crack open a beer, and just talk about terrible things that are not coronavirus? Maybe not even politics! Maybe even games!



Well, we got your back. Tonight, 6PM cartime, 8PM indiantime, 9PM puritantime, 10PM bananantime, 9AM Saturday duriantime, we shall convene for an impromptu sovbeerhour. Alcohol highly encouraged.

All are welcome, call your your friends, call your enemies, call your online gaming buddies, call your sentient spambots, let's see if they can beat us.
