Since Caltech dropped its on-campus mask requirement, this week's Sovereignty Club meeting will once again be in Caltech's Behavioral Biology Lab, B101.Â  The location is indicated on the map.Â  Go to the X, descend the stairs, and enter the lounge.Â  There will be free pizza, as always.Â Â 

New PCC members are especially encouraged to come.Â Â As always, the first 30 minutes is "bullshit period", where we discuss anything or everything.Â  Want to talk about the war in Ukraine, or about how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is going?Â  Come join us.

After the first 30 minutes, Leonid continues his Russian Revolution series:

*After the FebruaryÂ Revolution, theÂ RussianÂ Empire became one of the freest countries in the World (where, by saying 'free', I actually mean both benefits and drawbacks). In Russia particularly that period could only be matched by the 1990s after the dissolution of USSR. However, it didn't take long until such a state of 'liberty and brotherhood' fell to the hands of Bolshevik party and started its descent into totalitarianism. This presentation is going to run through the year 1917, emphasizing the possible causes for such an instability.*
