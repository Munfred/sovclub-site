**I'll put this first since nobody reads emails:** Friday 5-7pm cartime there'll be a v irtual club fair using discord. It's basically an extra meeting of pure bullshit where we;ll have the chance to entrap virtual passerbys. It will be fun. On Friday the discord link will be available here: [http://ore.caltech.edu/clubs/‚Äãfair](http://ore.caltech.edu/clubs/fair). Now for today's agenda...\

We don't usually discuss current events as the main topic but...this year the [UN General Assembly](https://www.un.org/en/ga/) meeting moved online, with mostly pre-recorded speeches. I thought it'd be fun to watch some video compilation of the highlights, but none seems to exist. I did find however a [Politico's newsletter discussing](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/global-translations/2020/09/23/from-imagine-to-trumpcraft-490415) [yesterday events](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/global-translations/2020/09/23/from-imagine-to-trumpcraft-490415). But in the event you really want to watch the speeches, I did find the [full list of video addresses from each country](http://webtv.un.org/search?lan=english&cat=General%20Assembly) (I did look up the one from [Rwanda](http://webtv.un.org/search/rwanda-president-addresses-general-debate-75th-session/6193568186001/?term=&lan=english&cat=General%20Assembly&page=4) - it is very boring*). I also discovered that they [use emojis](https://journal.un.org/en/meeting/officials/ebd6ab5e-c0de-ea11-9114-0050569e8b67/2020-09-23/statements) in their list of written statements. Very avant garde.\

\*by accident I found out Rwanda's president email: [paulkagame@gov.rw](mailto:paulkagame@gov.rw). Because he put it on his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PaulKagame). What should we write to him?
