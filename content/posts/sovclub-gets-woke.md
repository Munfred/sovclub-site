This week’s lecture has been officially* listed with Caltech’s Office of the Registrar. Please find the course description below.



Sovclub \[1 unit, pizza included, bullshit not graded]

This week’s sovclub will provide attendees with a crash course on the past 300 years of Western intellectual history. All participants should walk away with an almost shaky understanding of everything from [Hegel’s The Phenomenology of Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phenomenology_of_Spirit) to the [newest season of Mike Judge’s Silicon Valley](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=jump+the+shark), and be able to trace the influences of the [central intellectual themes of this period](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/) to their [contemporary manifestations](https://www.reed.edu/reed_magazine/summer2007/features/C_A_FL/index.html), such as the Trump impeachment hearings, [White Fragility](https://libjournal.uncg.edu/ijcp/article/viewFile/249/116), and [Trigglypuff](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trigglypuff).



But seriously, we’re going to talk about [White Fragility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjHg65JORi8), in [particular](https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/18/white-fragility-inherently-racist-idea-retired-immediately/) ([see paper](https://libjournal.uncg.edu/ijcp/article/view/249)), and the possibility of [generalizing Western social narratives to a more international context](https://pastebin.com/raw/6519iTdu), in general ([see WIP manuscript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ahiYg3RrjA-sYen2potjnjSoUmLdWaClhLVRuP7GAKo/edit?usp=sharing), please contribute) This promises to be a vegetable-throwing good time!



\*unofficially, like Jeff and Taiwan



See you at 6pm,
