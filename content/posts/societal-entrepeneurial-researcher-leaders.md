We -- the world, not just America -- needs better leaders, particularly in government. The kinds of leaders we need today not only should be extremely smart, they should:



1. Be driven to doing things with other people, especially through the  government.
2. Have in depth technical expertise in at least one area. It doesn’t matter so much which area, as much as it matters that they appreciate the importance of technical expertise and are able to quickly grasp important technical aspects in other areas.
3. Have the capacity to think things through, experiment, take in new evidence, adapt and change directions, somewhat like a researcher. Look at things objectively and act as they are, not as you wish they were. In the social realm this attitude seems to have been personified by Albert Hirschman, and in governance by Lee Kuan Yew. 
4. Have a set of values that somewhat roughly falls in line with western values: Individual liberty is good and don’t disregard human life willy-nilly.



(1) is a basic requirement for being effective at anything in the social realm,

(2) will be ever more necessary to be effective in the next decades as technology pervades everything 

(3) is needed to be actually able to improve societies at a faster pace than every other generation (which is the pace at which experimentation happens when people don’t want to experiment: one generation dies then the next tries something else)  

(4) is really the only thing standing in the way of a repeat of the 1930s and every other bad autocracy. 



Perhaps the reason why 20th century America was so successful is that it was able to enrich it’s society with people bearing those qualities, while 20th century europe really lacked #4 after WWI, and almost all countries that went communist lacked all four in their leadership and in most of society (by killing or driving away people that had any of those).



There is no sure way to totally guarantee that leaders in a society will have those 4 features, but a way to increase the odds that they do (and reduce the damage caused when they don’t) is to enrich society for people with those features. Additionally, enriching society for people like that means that there is more chance of continuity of good government. For long term stability, even if your society has a small elite with those features and one of them ends up amassing power and running things well, continuity of good governance will be jeopardized upon any change in government (as happened in Portugal under Salazar).



Thinking in the short term: Without immediately taking the long and hard solution of educating many people very well, is there a way we could enrich societies across the globe with leaders having those features within one generation, or even faster? 



I think so, if for a given society we could nucleate a critical mass of people with these features before they commit to other paths in life, and get them interested in government and feeling empowered to act. For example, CEOs will often check all the four boxes, but they are already committed to a certain path and would be very unlikely to want to run for office or join the government. (There are interesting exceptions, especially  when they get recruited to high posts, but those are few).



We want very smart, technically trained people who can think and work their way through hard problems without giving up, and have not yet committed to a certain parth. We want to try to find them in bulk (as opposed to painstakingly one by one through social connections for example) and even more ambitiously, we want to be able to do that in different countries and societies. And then we want to get them interested in government and empower them to act. Where on earth can we find such people? 



Here's an idea: In graduate school, especially (but not only) for the sciences and engineering. The process of obtaining a PhD is remarkably uniform across countries: people come in batches, and work for 4+ years trying to make progress on some new and hard problem. 



People that are working for years on a hard problem without a clear path to a solution have likely demonstrated (2) and (3), while (4) is part of a set of values that I don't think we can do so much about to affect later in life, just screen for. That leaves us with (1), which is certainly something that graduate students are NOT selected for.  Graduate students are often not very interested in doing things with other people, or at least that they don’t realize to what extent they could be doing very impactful things outside the lab -- they look at how hard their research problems are, and extrapolate that to everything else. However, I think that of the four features, (1) is the most pliable one and can be changed, especially if you have the luxury of changing that mindset over the course of a few years, as a grad student continues working on their research project.



I think the stereotype that I’m looking for is that of an “societal-entrepreneurial researcher leader”: someone with the training and analytic skills that it takes to do good research, coupled with a big drive and desire for doing things in society and getting others together to do things (if you think that sounds weird, consider that Angela Merkel is a quantum chemist PhD and had several research articles published prior to entering politics). The latter part is very much the stereotype of the startup crowd, the word entrepreneurial captures that general attitude, but not restricted to the realm of corporate entities.



The higher education system of most countries is already producing many people with the researcher features, minus the societal-entrepreneurial part. How could we get them to realize they can do more, and to want to do more, and to help them do more? It heavily depends on which society we are in: many countries will have social settings that are very hostile to these entrepreneurship attitudes, eschewing everything that is different. Arguably such places are exactly where the most difference can be made by enriching for such societal-entrepreneurial researcher leaders.  



For example, I look back to my trajectory coming from Brazil: the universities are ok-ish, but hardly any real cutting edge research, and society is totally averse to new things, and there is no support structure for doing anything out of the ordinary. Nevertheless a certain amount of good people with good technical training and true desire for doing things exists in the country (with 200 million people you’d hope there’d be at least a few of them...). I’m confident that is the case in every other [level 2 and level 3 economies](https://www.gapminder.org/fw/income-levels/) (using Hans Rosling taxonomy) - they are producing enough people with technical and intellectual training to start with. 



How can we leverage this potential leadership capital across the globe? Two things occur to me:



Better connect them with the rest of the world. They are already the buddying intellectual cream in their respective societies (which often is not that high of a bar), and are typically completely starved for meaningful connections, examples, and a path to making impact, because the default path in their home societies focuses on conformism: not doing anything different, and following the path most taken. Smart people in level 2 and 3 countries will often have a particular kind of impostor syndrome when comparing themselves with role models in level 1 countries or people that "made it" in their own countries. The result is that they frequently think they are not good enough, and are paralyzed to act. The primary goal of better connecting them with the rest of the world, and especially with role models in level 1 countries is to show that they are actually just as capable as these people they admire. Get them inspired to act and thinking about what they could do. 



Teach them how the government works, and how to be effective working in or with the government. Restricting this analysis to nominal, semi-functional democracies (most of the Americas, Europe, India, South Africa, half of Asia): The dynamics exhibited by these governments and societies has really remarkable parallels, and many of the general lessons on how to be effective in one can be applicable in the other. Then there is another layer of the local societal dynamics, dictated by the specific government structure, local culture, and regional factors of each country. However, we should not underestimate the degree to which the challenges are the same -- that's why the developing world diplomats created the BRICS, which really started with just Brazil, India and South Africa: because they saw how many of the challenges they faced were the same. 



Climbing the rungs of power and solving world problems is a hard challenge, to put it mildly. There is no one size fits all solution, it is always going to be context dependent - regional culture, regional politics, regional economy.  It takes a lot of thinking to  find a potential path and mode of action.



I suspect that this approach would work best in places that are considered democracies or flawed democracies -- where there is enough institutional structure left that you can figure out the rules of the game and devise a strategy. In autocratic countries with very opaque governments it might be too hard to figure out the rules for this strategy to work, or the rules might change on you, or there might not be rules at all because things are so dependent on few individuals. But in most other places, the level 1, 2 and 3 countries of Hans Rosling.



Having said all this, here is an idea that you should attempt to rip to shreds.I took inspiration from the [Foresight Foundation](https://foresight.org/), a nonprofit that has been running international discussion groups on focused science and technology for several decades.



What if we picked some cities in a handful of level 2 and 3 countries and attempted to nucleate local sovclubs by offering a small stipend fellowship (complimentary to a grad student stipend, but very meaningful in level 2 and 3 countries) for a few graduate students in local universities, with the goal of having them meet regularly and interact with local and global leaders?

Could sovclub be the template for the next revolution in global policy? Could sovclub help [Biden prove that democracy works](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/25/politics/biden-autocracies-versus-democracies/index.html) by hijacking democracy?
