It's not easy to run a not entirely autocratic/anarchic country/organization/​institution/group/club. If someone is not gonna be calling *all* the shots, you need rule of law, and when you write down the law you got a [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution). But here's the catch: the first time you write a constitution you can pretty much do whatever you want, since presumably you want to ignore everything before!



So you call a [constituent assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_assembly) with your friends, write down your wildest dreams and aspirations, and then it becomes a problem for the generations of the future to deal with it! (I'm looking at you, 🇮🇳🇺🇸🇧🇷🇫🇷🇦🇷🇲🇽 et al. ). Most of what you dream will probably be set up in stone and be too annoying to overturn constitutionally, sticking around until the next revolution. As wikipedia puts it:



> *As the fundamental document constituting a state, a constitution cannot normally be modified or amended by the state's normal legislative procedures; instead a constitutional convention or a constituent assembly, the rules for which are normally laid down in the constitution, must be set up. A constituent assembly is usually set up for its specific purpose, which it carries out in a relatively short time, after which the assembly is dissolved.*



***And now, for a limited time only, you too can be a founding father/mother/hijra/Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicoper of Sovereignty Club!**** I proudly present you the the working draft of the

*[Sovereignty Club Constitution v19.07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2KZgRUbrxrfKcA5IiHkxdEK2Oe729vmSVcqMzSMovs/edit?usp=sharing).*

Recent additions/sections highlighted in green. Please go wild and write whatever you want\*\*. Bonus points if you can ostensibly, but not actually, violate the [Student Club Handbook](http://clubs.caltech.edu/documents/34-club_handbook-revised_dec_2016.pdf). The same applies for American and international law. Bring your laptop/phone/ideas for the constitutional assembly. Thanks.
