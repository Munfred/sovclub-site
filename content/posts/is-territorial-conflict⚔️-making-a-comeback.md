Come join foreign policy analyst, author, and Slate writer [Joshua Keating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Keating "https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Keating") to discuss how various deals and compromises instituted in the late 20th century to preserve "cartographical stasis" are coming under stress.  We will especially talk about Taiwan, Ukraine, Ethiopia, and Northern Ireland.  Will any of it lead to WWIII?  Only time will tell.

Keating is the author of *Invisible Countries*, a wonderful book about country-like places that many countries really, *really* don't want to recognize as countries.  Places like ~~Artsakh~~ Azerbaijan (the focal point of the Armenia-Azerbaijan war), ~~Taiwan~~ Republic of China, ~~Somaliland~~ Somalia, and ~~Abkhazia~~ Georgia.  Keating is also a writer for Slate, and wrote the popular [If It Happened There](https://slate.com/tag/if-it-happened-there "https\://slate.com/tag/if-it-happened-there") series, "a regular feature in which American events are described using the tropes and tone normally employed by the American media to describe events in other countries".  He also wrote the inspiration for this week's talk: <https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/the-peace-deals-of-the-90s-are-breaking-down.html>

Wednesday 6:00--6:30 pm: bullshit period (international news discussion); 6:30--7:30: Keating's presentation + discussion.  <https://caltech.zoom.us/my/sovcall>
