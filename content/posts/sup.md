After the longest shutdown in Sovclub's history - 55 days and counting - weâ€™re finally back to action bullshit.



A lot has happened. Eduardo revisited his [homeland](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13TB3xXwxOoz2uIB0yCo5axXXbikyEt0n7DIbT9qHkR0/edit?usp=sharing). World leaders left and right did their thing. Raj now has more [praxis](https://www.facebook.com/rajashik.tarafder/videos/2855337177864930/UzpfSTEwMDAwMTY2MDI4Mjk2MTozMDYwNjExMjk0OTk0MTQ6MTA6MDoxNTgwNTQzOTk5OjEzMzQ4MzQ1NzI1MzA2MzY1MDg/) than all the rest of this club put together.



So, to catch up with whatâ€™s new with the worldâ„¢ tomorrowâ€™s meeting will be open for anyone to tell us about things. I heard Raj wanted to say something.



See you tomorrow at 6PM on Sovereignty Lounge, BBB B101.



In Sovereignty,



Eduardo

PS: After a month in Brazil I brought back several liters of cachaÃ§a (brazilian rum) and have been debating whether to provide Brazilâ€™s national cocktail at the meeting. Please express your preferences [here](https://forms.gle/G8SMjojwuGb2Xvhr6) and youâ€™ll probably be heard.
