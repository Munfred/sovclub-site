Tonight at 5:30PM cartime we will watch the  [sovclubbiest movie ever.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qS2NtbEoIc8)



It is on Netflix so you (probably) don't need to worry.

PS: The reason we're starting half an hour later is because at 4PM I'll be hosting a happy hour for the folks that participated in the Caltech Y Science Policy Symposium this week, and I anticipate it run long. (spoiler: It won't, because everyone at Caltech who can endure me for more than an hour is already at sovclub). Anyway, you are welcome to show up early is that kinda thing tickles your fancy.
