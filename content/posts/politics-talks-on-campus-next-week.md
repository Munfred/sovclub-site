Hello all, by coincidence there are two lunch talks of general interest to sovclub happening Tuesday and Wednesday next week. The Wednesday talk is part of International Education Week, which will be having talks at noon (and therefore lunch) every day of the week at Avery Library. Food was good last year.



Also, spoiler alert: due to inclement bullshit this week we didn't get around to the actual topic, so next week's topic is going to be [Kofi Annan](https://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/t/november-16-the-baddest-ass-kofi-annan-secretary-general/152), unless someone else wants to present something or take us somewhere. If you are in need of amusement, check out [Kofi describing what is basically a sovclub meeting](https://pastebin.com/WDBC41EM), except instead of Stick Fight it ends with Iraq Fight.



💘💝💖💗💓💞💕💟💔❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤, Eduardo



**Nuclear Diplomacy - How States Make Peace Despite the Atom**\
**Wednesday, Nov 20 | 12:00 - 1:00 PM | Avery Library**

*Presented by undergraduate student Damien Bérubé.*In 1953, U.S. President Eisenhower gave a speech to the UN General Assembly titled, "Atoms for Peace." The initial optimism of this new nuclear-powered world soon gave way to the fear of nuclear proliferation and mismanagement of radioactive materials. In a series of technical and diplomatic feats, nations around the world have managed to keep the spread of atomic material in check. The first of such historic agreements, signed in 1963 between the US, UK and USSR, banned the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, and in doing so, paved the way for bigger and bolder international treaties. This is the story of the precious-yet-precarious nuclear diplomacy.

Washington D.C. has a wealth of opportunities for scientists and students interested in exploring the policy world and contributing to the understanding and implementation of science nationwide. From short-term internships for undergrads and grads, during breaks in study, to multi-year fellowships for graduates of undergrad and grad programs. Join us for a lunch discussion to hear from two current Caltech Grad students who took advantage of some of these opportunities, as they share their experiences and some other opportunities out there.\

STPI is a federally-funded research and development center that provides technical expertise and policy analysis to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and other science-conducting agencies of the federal government.\

**Sarah Cohen, a fifth year graduate student in biology,** spent three months in D.C. as an undergraduate working for AAAS as a summer Intern, in their Office of Government Relations. The AAAS Office of Government Relations works with Congress to provide non-partisan information on issues involving STEM. They also connect legislators with the STEM community and publish a science policy newsletter, AAAS Policy Alert, which informs AAAS members on current science policy issues.
