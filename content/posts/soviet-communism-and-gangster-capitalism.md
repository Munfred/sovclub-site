So Austin Bailed on us yet again. Fortunately (or not) for all of you, thanks to Michael's suggestion, I started watching the Yale lectures of the course [Power and Politics in Today's World](https://communications.yale.edu/2019-devane-lectures-power-and-politics-todays-world#:~:text=About%20'Power%20and%20Politics'&text=Sterling%20Professor%20of%20Political%20Science,in%20Yale's%20DeVane%20Lecture%20series.&text=Shapiro%20also%20served%20as%20Henry%20R.). I made it as far as *[lecture 2:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5nbT4xQqwI&list=PLh9mgdi4rNeyViG2ar68jkgEi4y6doNZy&index=3&t=0s)* [From Soviet Communism to Russian Gangster Capitalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5nbT4xQqwI&list=PLh9mgdi4rNeyViG2ar68jkgEi4y6doNZy&index=3&t=0s). And that's enough for a whole meeting. (too bad it's 4am in Russia when we meet, otherwise we should get Nadia to give us a rundown...)



Tonight we're gonna talk about the collapse of the soviet union and what followed. We'll talk about things like why the hell did it collapse like that? And why was it **peaceful**? And what happened next?



I do heartily recommend the lecture, which is an hour long. But here's mine and Michael's TDLR, which I'm sure nobody will read.



See you tonight!



Eduardo & Michael

Michael's summary



*Why did Soviet Union collapse?*

* Dysfunctional economy--nothing in Moscow‚Äôs state department store
* Costly and failed invasion of Afghanistan
* Costly arms race, especially after Reagan‚Äôs Star Wars initiative

*Why was the collapse so peaceful?*

* ‚ÄúExit, Voice, and Loyalty‚Äù by Albert Hirschmann: in a declining organization, people‚Äôs reactions depend on the relative costs of exit, voice, and loyalty
* Loyalty had ceased to exist. On professor‚Äôs trip to the USSR, the first KGB agent he met wanted to sell him currency on the black market. The second wanted him to facilitate arms sells to South Africa, including nuclear arms. A communist reformer that he met screamed at him, calling him a Stalinist for suggesting gradual reform. The reformer said he concluded the system was broken in 1978.
* Exit costs drastically reduced because former Soviet bureaucrats could seize state assets for themselves, and Yeltsin could become president of Russia

*Rise of the oligarchs*

* Soviets made offshore bank accounts to keep money safe. The managers of those bank accounts took the money.
* During collapse, former Soviet officials gave gas fields to themselves and to friends
* Loans for shares scheme: to finance his reelection, Yeltsin gave shares in state oil companies in exchange for loans. Russia then went bankrupt, and creditors kept the oil companies
* Weak and bankrupt state was dominated by oligarchs

*Why is Russia so corrupt?*

* Existence of oligarchs due to collapse (path dependence)
* Resource curse from Russia‚Äôs oil dependence (economics)



## Eduardo's summary

* Wow russia USSR military, [trying to coup and falling on your face so hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt) to keep the regime going
* USSR leaders in 1991 were convinced the central planning stuff didn't work since 1978
* When shit hits the fan what happens? [Exit, voice, loyalty.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty) Gotta read that book.
* USSR imploded \*peacefully\* because no loyalty from the elites
* Overnight bureaucracy disappeared, the government was literally looted due to lack of oversight. No checks nor balances, incredible.
* How was it possible for the \*bureaucracy\* to disappear overnight? He didn't explain that.
* I wonder what are the world textbooks of privatization examples done (right and wrong). Russia is certainly wrong. Has anyone done it right? Singapore created state companies and is holding on them. China too. Imagine CCP goes kaput, how'd you privatize chinese companies? Do we have success examples? Where does Brazil stand in this balance?
* Current Russia is 75% dependent on oil. Wow!
