We talk a lot about democracies and autocracies, about communism and capitalism, about regimes and ideologies. But rarely, I think, do we talk about the very nature of the state. 



Some states (nation states, I guess) seem to exist because there is some kind of deeper social glue, culture, beliefs, that make people act coherently and stick together. Like ants. Other states exist in contravention to all that, much life at the mercy of evolution, devoid of agency except for the sake of self perpetuation. Like the grey goo.



As Michael put it in his [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1qO_IfEa7t2YT3mN3F2LnWiuqIo-OYMt9YqmDSabxO2E/edit):



Triviality Hypothesis

A trivial state seeks simply its own perpetuation.  No vision, no ideology, no socialism.  A trivial state could be strong; it could be activist in public policy to achieve order and stability; it is unpredictable abroad.  A trivial state running into trouble at home might use foreign adventurism to purchase legitimacy.  It is dangerous because it wants respect, but has nothing except strength to be respected for; it has none of the soft power of American culture or of Scandinavian welfare statism.



This simple, brilliant, deep concept is not mine, nor Michael, but (I think?) introduced by Hannah Arendt in her book [Origins of Totalitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origins_of_Totalitarianism) which I really should read but at 704 pages it might take me a while to get around to.



Fortunately there is another little book, clocking just over 200 pages, called T[he Perfect Dictatorship: China in the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Dictatorship-China-21st-Century/dp/9888208942). It is about this book that Michael’s notes actually are, and the triviality hypothesis is explored in connection to the CCP state. I thought it was incredible, one of only a [handful](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q5RQfKlO2FM6Bc9qlwEZSTsNQdF8qhOqCNnZ4sQUfm0/edit?usp=sharing) of books to be awarded ⭐⭐⭐⭐ by me (yes four). This is what I wrote about it (because I only read the book once - Michael is far ahead of me when it comes to note taking):



Wow. Stein Ringen makes an in depth, yet concise, analysis of the modern chinese state. He lays the ground by diving at the core philosophical issues of what a state \_is\_ and what it is meant to \_do\_. From there he proceeds to describe what that modern chinese state \_does\_ and infer what kind of state it \_is\_. It truly is the best overview of modern china (meaning post reform and opening up, and especially the last decade and change)  that I have ever seen, in less than 200 pages! Anyone interested in China should have this as a high priority reading.



So! Come tonight to talk about whether modern CCP is the earthly embodiment of the perfect dictatorship, or whether they could be doing better.
