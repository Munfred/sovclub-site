Last week, during the Sovereignty Club meeting, Russia invaded Ukraine.  This week, Roman Korol, an Ukrainian student who told us about the Ukraine-Russia conflict two weeks ago, will (probably) come give us an update during the first 30 minutes.  Please come on time so that we have time to discuss.

Afterwards, Pastor Derek Berry from The Chapel, a church right across the street from my apartment, will come in person to tell us about the history and beliefs of Christianity.  This isn't Sunday school or interfaith dialogue, so bring whatever questions and comments you have, including challenging ones.  Don't agree just to be agreeable, or disagree just to be disagreeable.  If you are too timid with questions, I'll have questions prepared about Christian morality, historical waves of Christianization, the decline of religiosity in the West, the relationship of Christianity with other religions, and more.  Derek's summary:

*The core tenet of Christianity is what biblical authors refer to as “the gospel.” The gospel answers the burning questions that are seemingly etched into the heart of each and every human being.* 

*1.     How did we get here?*

*2.     What went wrong?*

*3.     How do we fix it?*

*With my time at the Sovereignty Club, I’ll be tackling how the gospel of the Lord Jesus, which is the nucleus of Christianity, provides answers to these three pivotal questions.* 

This is a joint event with the [Graduate Christian Fellowship](http://caltechgcf.weebly.com/ "http\://caltechgcf.weebly.com/").  Some GCF members will join, so we'll also get perspectives from ordinary practicing Christians.  This is also the first event of the World Religion series, where we invite clergy from the world's most prominent religions--Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism--to speak to us and answer our questions.  Have a suggestion for who I should invite for the other religions?  Let me know!
