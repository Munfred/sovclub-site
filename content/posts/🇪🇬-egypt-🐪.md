Last week, I went to Egypt.  Egypt is an ancient land that has shaped human history for thousands of years.  The earliest state of any significant size, its hieroglyphic writing system is the ancestor of nearly all writing systems today.  Egypt is where (according to the Bible) the Israelites were enslaved; it was the Mediterranean’s premier center of learning under Hellenistic rule; it was the breadbasket of the Roman empire; it was one of the great Christian centers; and it was one of the first Roman provinces to fall to the initial Muslim conquests.  Mamluk Egypt stopped Mongol expansion in 1260.   After being part of the Ottoman and British empires for centuries, newly independent Egypt sounded the death knell of the European empires by defying the English and French during the Suez Crisis.  Today’s Egypt is ruled by a military government and suffers a deep economic crisis, but Egypt is still the Arab world’s most populous country and its cultural capital.



Join us today to see pyramids, temples, and tombs from 3300 years ago; churches from 1400 years ago; fortresses from the medieval Islamic period; and modern day bazaars and slums.  I’ll also try to interweave a crash course on Egyptian history, and share some observations of Egyptian culture.
