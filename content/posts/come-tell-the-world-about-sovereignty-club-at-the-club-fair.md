The Student Clubs and Involvement Fair is happening today, October 4, 2019 from 5pm to 7pm on Beckman Mall (in front of the wedding cake). Come say hi.



Due to my incapacity to plan I'm only getting back tomorrow from my investigative trip on the nordics, but Michael has bravely volunteered to field our table and co-opt unsuspecting new souls into the mailing list. If you are free between 5-7pm you should come by! We will have:\
\
- Flags of countries that are no more

\- St. Snowden's statue

\- Mr. Raffles, the authentic chinese-singaporean bear

\- The sovhammer

\- Possibly the best world atlas ever published (inquire Dylan about it)

\- Copies of the constitution, I hope (see below!)

\- A computer where you can sign up for our mailing list



In addition to the coveted prize of self-respect, for those that show up we're providing the unique opportunity of being able to tell the people that walk by *anything that you want***.** That's right, no club-mandated propaganda, no tip-toeing along the party lines, **you** decide what truths to tell them! (by the end of it just make sure to get them to sign up for the mailing list).



But, if you can't make it, that's okay too. We'll resume meetings next Wednesday 6pm with *The truth about e-Estonia.* You won't want to miss it. Tell your friends.



And, before I head out, one more important thing happened since [St. Snowden's revelations were published](http://libgen.is/search.php?req=edward+snowden+permanent+record&open=0&res=25&view=simple&phrase=1&column=def): The [Sovereignty Club Constitution v19.09.19](https://caltechsovereignty.club/constitution.pdf) was approved! That's right, we're now, again, a real club, a proud, legitimate, member of the wesphalian inter-club system. Everyone is surprised. I am attaching the **approved** constitution for your perusal amusement.



Cheers,



Eduardo
