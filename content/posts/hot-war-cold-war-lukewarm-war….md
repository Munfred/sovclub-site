Room temperature war?

Weâ€™ve been talking about China and the future of the free world a bunch lately, and so have the folks at Foreign Affairs. In a recent article, boldly titled [There Will Not Be a New Cold War](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-03-24/there-will-not-be-new-cold-war), Thomas J. Christensen makes the case...that is stated in the title. And honestly he makes a bunch of pretty good points. Oddly the conclusion is in agreement with the over I derived from our new [liquid reality](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1rhk6r6d-6IMX7y74QfG6KyJLCf_5eWGKYnUPP3BZvk8/edit), and in contrast to when our beloved Kevin Rudd had predicted Cold war v1.5 - a mere 10 months ago - and that [with the wrong decisions, the 2020s will look like a mindless rerun of the 1930s; the right decisions, however, could pull us back from the abyss](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tZqD16Bq1E5Xgzoieost955F6Rmp8Z9x/view?usp=sharing).Â 



So if there wonâ€™t be a cold war, there wonâ€™t be a hot war. Could we have a room temperature war? What if this unprecedented age of peace and stability so lowered our standard threshold for violence that weâ€™re just perpetually in war.Â  Like [Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_geography_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four), you know? Bear with me, it wonâ€™t be worth it, I promise.Â 



In the age of Âµaggression, why canâ€™t we have Âµwars? If a trade war has war in the name and nobody is being directly hurt, doesnâ€™t the same logic apply to turning everything else into an act of war, allowing us to live in a state of total war amidst ever growing prosperity? Surely if the snowflake generation has their feelings hurt at every turn along the way, when you [hurt the feelings of a whole peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurting_the_feelings_of_the_Chinese_people), that must count for something? If a million Âµaggressions make one Âµwar, all it takes is a Gaggression to make a war. When they said [sticks and stones may break my bones, but words shall never hurt me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticks_and_Stones), I bet they were not expecting that with all the technological advancements that enabled industrialized destruction in the great wars weâ€™d eventually reach industrial scale feeling hurtness - as many as 1.4 billion feelings hurt with as few as a handful of [flags](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201909/24/WS5d8986b2a310cf3e3556d233.html). Thatâ€™s 1.4 mwar. Do that twice a day, we got a whole war per year. Surely that counts as room temperature war?
