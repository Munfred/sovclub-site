In 800 BC, the Greeks were eking out an existence in impoverished city states and infertile fields, the illiterate remnants of an apocalypse that destroyed their civilization 400 years prior. They could not have imagined that they would rise from the ashes to become the premier civilization of the Mediterranean, spreading their new culture from Spain to India. Greek innovations in politics, philosophy, and art would form the foundation of Western civilization. Perhaps the most impactful Greek contributions were in science. Far surpassing all other ancient civilizations, the Greeks used the scientific method to discover Earth's shape, measure its circumference, calculate the size and distance of the Moon, and debate whether Earth orbits the Sun. I will tell the story of this remarkable civilization, discuss how they learned about the cosmos, and summarize the pivotal role their achievements played in kickstarting the Scientific Revolution and ushering in modernity.



This is a practice talk for my astronomy public outreach lecture on Friday: [https://www.astro.â€‹caltech.edu/outreach/images/â€‹20200904V.pdf](https://www.astro.caltech.edu/outreach/images/20200904V.pdf)



Everyone is welcome, both to the practice talk and to the lecture.
