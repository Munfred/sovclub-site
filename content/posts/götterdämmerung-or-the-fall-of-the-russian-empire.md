This week, Leonid Pereiaslov will tell us about the leadup to the Russian Revolution.  Incidentally, Mike Duncan has an [ongoing podcast series](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/ "https\://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/") about the Russian Revolution, which you can check out if you want the gory details.  Leonid's summary:

*"Vladimir Putin has once called the collapse of the Soviet Union "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century", but he was badly wrong. It was the dissolution of the third-largest greatest empire in history which has irrevocably changed the course of humanity in such a way that no one would expect and that left 10-17 millions of citizens of Russia dead and 2 millions seeking new home among the long list of countries from Bulgaria to China.*

*A land of Tchaikovsky and Tolstoy, Denikin and Witte, Stolypin and Rasputin, which was doomed to die in agony? A series of talks, focused on Russian Revolution, is going to start with the first presentation about life (and death) of ordinary people during the last years of Russian Empire's existence. Lots and lots of tables with unique historical data from contemporary documents, paintings and photos are awaiting you."*
