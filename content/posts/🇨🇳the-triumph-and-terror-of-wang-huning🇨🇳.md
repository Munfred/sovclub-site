Tonight we will discuss two collapses: The physical environment and the cultural environment.  As humanity develops more and more powerful technology, the extraction of resource from nature and the liberation of carbon into the atmosphere has provoked a period of accelerating change in the Earth system.  The reciprocal of this extraction is our psychic retreat away from nature into synthetic human environments, the prehistoric cave taken to it's ultimate manifestation: great cities of technology, artifice, and simulation.  These processes are provoking new crises and new methods to resolve them.  COP26 is the venue in which the sclerotic leaders of the first world haggle with the ambitions of third over the destiny of humanity.  Can nine billion big-wrinkle apes solve the ultimate cooperative problem, or will we squabble until the world is rendered uninhabitable for many? 



And at this pivotal moment, the west faces a moment of cultural degeneration and purposelessness.   As China watches from afar, it attempts to prevent a similar cascading cultural failure by using the power of the state to shape society.  These are the plans of Wang Huning, the ideas man behind Big Xi.  His policies include almost completely restricting children from playing video games, a prohibition on minors livestreaming, abolishing for profit tutoring, and mandating homework pressures on children are lifted.  The states cracks down on corruption, bans cryptocurrency, 'effeminate men', ASMR and the gruelling 9-9-6 workweek.  The height of skyscrapers is limited, 'weird architecture' prohibited, and celebrities who flaunt their obscene wealth are disappeared.  All while the activity of everyday life occurs under constant surveillance and censorship.  Clearly, Wang Huning and the upper echelons of the CCP have identified what they think is the cause of American Malaise: individualism, grotesque wealth, divisive woke politics, digital hedonism, work as the (only) purpose of life, and a nihilistic cultural, economic, and political free-for-all that pits a society against itself, with no shared values or purpose to work from. 



The centrepiece of our discussion tonight is this remarkable article in Palladium Mag, **which I cannot recommend strongly enough**: **[The Triumph and Terror of Wang Huning](https://palladiummag.com/2021/10/11/the-triumph-and-terror-of-wang-huning/ "https\://palladiummag.com/2021/10/11/the-triumph-and-terror-of-wang-huning/")**.  A key quote: *Although Americans can perceive that they are faced with “intricate social and cultural problems,” they “tend to think of them as scientific and technological problems” to be solved separately. This gets them nowhere, he argues, because their problems are in fact all inextricably interlinked and have the same root cause: a radical, nihilistic individualism at the heart of modern American liberalism. “the American economic system has created human loneliness” as its foremost product, along with spectacular inequality. As a result, “nihilism has become the American way, which is a fatal shock to cultural development and the American spirit.”*
