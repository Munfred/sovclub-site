From Brener:

Would you like to have your own city somewhere that is a paradise?\
Would you like for this city to be a profitable business arbitraging the nonsensical immigration laws of the Empire?\
Would you like to know what challenges you will face once you get started?

If you answered yes to any of the above, come to sovclub tomorrow.
