When you got a good thing going it's hard to get through all of it in just one call. So tonight we'll go over [Michael's notes (2021) vol. 2](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1qO_IfEa7t2YT3mN3F2LnWiuqIo-OYMt9YqmDSabxO2E/edit) of the little red book [The Perfect Dictatorship: China in the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Dictatorship-China-21st-Century/dp/9888208942) by [Stein Ringen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein_Ringen).

We will talk about what they do, what they produce, who they are, and where they are going.

See you at 6PM!  [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)

In sovereignty,

Eduardo
