Hello, this is Sam.

Some of you may have heard I was gonna do a presentation on aliens at some point. That’s still to come.

For tomorrow, I will indoctrinate you all into the cult of public transit, and work everyone up into a fervor about the new BRT system that will connect Pasadena to Glendale, Burbank, and North Hollywood.

Attached are some memes courtesy of the Facebook group NUMTOTs, or [New Urbanist Memes for Transit-Oriented Teens](https://www.facebook.com/groups/whatwouldjanejacobsdo/).

There’s even a Singapore thing in there for Eduardo.
