I’ve always had great awe for people who, possessing a seemingly magical power of understanding and synthesis, could convey accurately, yet concisely, the state of human affairs of entire civilizations. People such as [Will Durant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Durant), who wrote [The Story of Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Civilization) covering multiple civilizations over 11 volumes, and whom every time Michael would quote filled me with awe and respect. How in a single lifetime can someone grasp a civilization, let alone several? Maybe it’s like languages, where it gets easier as you master more. 

 

But now, after the several months of forced solitude and a slower, more contemplative, way of life, I think I begin to get a glimpse of how they do it (or maybe it’s a glimpse about how retired people feel, hard to tell).



What I cannot shake is the feeling that, having again gotten into the habit of reading books, and reading many around the same topics, patterns, and at least an illusion (or delusion?) of understanding, begins to form. Is this really all it takes to become wise? Take it easy, read books, and stop checking social media every five minutes? How astray has humankind gone. 



Yet! As this understanding forms, as the same patterns get highlighted by different people in different contexts, you begin to believe you understand something. But you can never be too sure. At least not until you come across someone echoing not only your feelings, but your very same conclusions, driven by an entirely different context and time, which nevertheless bears an eerie parallel with the one driving your conclusions.  



I[ want to share with you a little something](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NO_5SKRRTAUpoBY73d8OYqaWRtqCBBJK/view?usp=sharing) I read on Sunday morning - a mere 12 pages! - but which catalyzed an avalanche of thought. It is [attached](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NO_5SKRRTAUpoBY73d8OYqaWRtqCBBJK/view?usp=sharing), **take a moment to read it**. It is the introduction of a 1941 book called “Brazil: Land of the Future” (which in contemporary mentions usually gets the addendum “...and it will always be.”).



It was written by Stefan Zweig, an Austrian writer who discovered Brazil in the late 1930s, became enamoured with it and moved to Petrópolis in Rio at the outbreak of the war, which had made him so bitter he and his wife suicided there in 1942 (clearly despite all the nice words the banana niceties were not nicer than the horrors of Europe). 



The remarks and conclusions he makes about Brazil in the backdrop of 1930s Europe are eerily similar to the ones I’ve been gathering in the backdrop of 2020s America, after having devoted very little thought to Brazil in the previous 5 years…



So! Inspired by this, today I want to share with you an idea. An idea so outlandish, so out there, so far beyond the norm, that it is all but unspeakable in normal circles, and in sovcircles it is bound to be mistaken by a joke, and not even a very good one. But, unlike my [jokes which look like serious ideas](https://xenocracy.org/), this one is a serious idea that looks like a joke.



Join us, tonight, starting at 5PM to learn what on earth this could possibly be about: [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)



In sovereignty,
