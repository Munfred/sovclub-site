Slavoj Zizek once said something like “the end goal of society should be that I do not have to participate in it, I should be taken care of.” I would find the actual quote if I could. To a large extent the world has figured this out, except for every few years where I have to worry about politics.



If you happen to have not thought about the structure of society for more than a few seconds, then you might think that democracy is as good as it gets. But what about democracy 2.0? What about a democracy where I have the option to not care about politics, but still feel like I am participating so I don’t accidentally overthrow the government?



Enter [Liquid Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy). Imagine your friend has all these good ideas about politics; they’re so smart that they should be made dictator. With Liquid Democracy, you can make them dictator, as far as your social circle is concerned, by delegating your votes to them. Now they can finally stop talking to you about voting for Elizabeth Warren/Ted Cruz/Bernie Sanders, and spend time actually educating themselves so they don’t in turn delegate their vote to any of those people.



Perhaps most importantly, we might be able to delegate IP and privacy issues to Eduardo, so he can stop telling us to join Matrix. And if he decides to sell out to Disney, we can withdraw our votes and find some other nerd to care on our behalf.



On its face, Liquid democracy seems to solve a lot of the problems with direct democracy---the fact that people are lazy and stupid---while keeping the upside: that the will of people is more quickly accounted for. But, there are many outstanding questions as well: How do we avoid disenfranchising people who aren’t on the digital platform this would necessitate. How do we decide what issues will be voted on? How do we categorize issues for the purposes of delegation? How do we avoid the collapse of the whole system once people can actually exercise their votes ala direct democracy if they chose to? How do we avoid swapping delegates at light speed once they actually make a compromise? I have no idea, I wrote this in like 15 minutes. Hopefully we can figure it out tonight, starting at 6pm cartime, after bullshit.
