Last week we kinda by accident ran intoÂ [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymI5Uv5cGU4)Â that runs through every civilizational border change year by year, and everyone was very enthralled, and agreed it'd be a great idea to livestream our sovreactions on Twitch.Â \
\
So tonight we'll do that, except instead of that video we'll watchÂ [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Wu0Q7x5D0)Â which is 19 minutes long and a little more complete, and instead of Twitch we'll use zoom.

\
So see you in zoom in 93 minutes:Â [https://caltech.zoom.â€‹us/j/4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)\

In sovereignty,

PS: At some point we should try cubechat:Â [https://cubechat.io/r/â€‹06547c4e689134e2528858b55a7d63â€‹25?g=5](https://cubechat.io/r/06547c4e689134e2528858b55a7d6325?g=5)Â 



PSS: But I heard Ben Ben already wants to try something during BS time today
