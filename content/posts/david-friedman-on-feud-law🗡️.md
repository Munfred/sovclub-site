Today at 6 pm, join us for a special session, where we'll have a famous guest speaker.  Economist, physicist, legal scholar, anarcho-capitalist theorist, and author of [Legal Systems Very Different From Ours](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Legal%20Systems/LegalSystemsContents.htm "http\://www.daviddfriedman.com/Legal%20Systems/LegalSystemsContents.htm"), [David Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Friedman "https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D.\_Friedman") will tell us about [feud law](https://liberty-intl.org/2016/02/21/how-to-stop-a-feud/ "https\://liberty-intl.org/2016/02/21/how-to-stop-a-feud/").  How do societies punish wrongdoers in the absence of a powerful state?  The wronged party has to do it themselves, with all of the moral and practical problems that creates.  Come hear about the intricate norms and rules pre-modern societies put into place to make feuds "work" better.  Friedman's chapter on feud law is attached in the email, in case you want to read it before the meeting.
