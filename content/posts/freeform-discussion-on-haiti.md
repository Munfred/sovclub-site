Tonight we will probably talk about Haiti, because I have had no time to prepare a topic. Michael seems to imply this pre-presidential-​assassination-documentary is good: [https://www.youtube.com/​watch?v=8ymQfDKWJZM&ab_​channel=Enqu%C3%​AAteExclusiveM6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ymQfDKWJZM&ab_channel=Enqu%C3%AAteExclusiveM6)

Very importantly: This SATURDAY 10AM PST we will have a special event with Alex Hochuli, author of the banananification of the world article: [https://​americanaffairsjournal.org/​2021/05/the-brazilianization-​of-the-world/](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2021/05/the-brazilianization-of-the-world/)

You should read it, it's real good. 

See you at 6PM at [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)

In sovereignty, 

Eduardo
