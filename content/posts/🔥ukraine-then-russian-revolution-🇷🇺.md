This week, like every week, we'll talk about international news for the first 30 minutes.Â  We'll of course discuss the war in Ukraine, along with anything else you want to talk about.

Afterward, Leonid will continue his series on the Russian Revolution.Â  His summary, including the introduction from last time:

*Vladimir Putin has once called the collapse of the Soviet Union "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century", but he was badly wrong. It was the dissolution of the third-largest greatest empire in history which has irrevocably changed the course of humanity in such a way that no one would expect and that left 10-17 millions of citizens of Russia dead and 2 millions seeking new home among the long list of countries from Bulgaria to China.Â A land of Tchaikovsky and Tolstoy, Denikin and Witte, Stolypin and Rasputin, which was doomed to die in agony? A series of talks, focused on Russian Revolution, is going to start with the first presentation about life (and death) of ordinary people during the last years of Russian Empire's existence.*Â 

*This week: the Great War (ironically, to end all wars) has been a final blow to several European monarchies: Austria-Hungary, Ottoman, German and Russian Empires stopped to exist as a result of this bloody conflict. Paradoxically, Russia is the only country in this list that has been fighting on the winning side. This presentation will briefly cover the course and impact of the warfare on the Russian state and show that the rear could be as important as the front, if not more.*
