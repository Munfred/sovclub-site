\~\~~Today’s discussion is brought to you by our very own [kremlinologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kremlinology) [sinologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinology) [CCPologist](https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/china2019/newsgraphics/chinese-communist-party-leaders/index.html), Austin. I merely fixed the links and added some dank \~\~~



And so, as America and the rest of the west are too busy dutifully swatting their own faces, [Beijing finally rolls in the tank](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3085412/two-sessions-2020-how-far-will-beijing-go-push-article-23).



NBD? 🇭🇰== 🇨🇳? [Everyone taking their time to do the funny business](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52674809)?



Let's take a look at what makes Hong Kong the goose that lays the golden eggs for China:

1. rule of law, common law (that's right, the one in basically every place the Brits stuck their flag on)
2. interconvertibility of currencies, with the local currency conveniently pegged to the US dollar since 1983 (the Brits didn't think their currency was good enough by then)
3. freedom of information
4. a liberal education system

Know of any places on the mainland that have any of the four above? I didn't think so.



But Hong Kong only contributes 2.7% of China's GDP, Beijing can totally nuke it, right?



Which seems to now be the million billion [362.7 billion](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS874US874&sxsrf=ALeKk02ff7T60WxoA8h1haqzTWDb3B7BYA%3A1590590071321&ei=d3rOXpmPE5qj5OUPvKaVsAY&q=hong+kong+gdp&oq=hong+kong+gdp&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BAgjECc6BQgAEJECOgQIABBDOgcIABBGEPsBUJgUWJArYJ4taABwAHgAgAGwAYgBoQ6SAQQwLjEzmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjZprzhodTpAhWaEbkGHTxTBWYQ4dUDCAw&uact=5) dollar question. For the longest time, Hong Kong’s real estate market [has been flooded with Chinese cash](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2100217/chinese-money-floods-hong-kong-property-beijing-set-check-taxpayers-foreign). If you were a smart capitalist who had moved your cash on the mainland into Hong Kong real estate, what's the logical next thing to do if Hong Kong is about to be annexed by lawless [bandits communists](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/19190975?hl=en)?



America wouldn't harm its own companies' interests in China? [Pompeo was in Israel to discuss annexing the West Bank](https://www.jewishpress.com/news/israel/israel-capitulates-to-pompeos-ultimatum-denies-china-worlds-largest-desalination-contract/2020/05/26/)?? Wut???



Here is a [Google translated, paste binned article on Hong Kong](https://pastebin.com/raw/SZXrd4G6), ostensibly from within the Party.
