In December, we invited Andy and Hrant, two Caltech Armenians, to tell us about the [Nagorno-Karabakh war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Nagorno-Karabakh_war "https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Nagorno-Karabakh_war") between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2020.  The war ended in a peace enforced by Russia.  With the war between Russia and Ukraine, tensions are [again mounting.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-28/azerbaijan-armenia-tensions-surge-with-russia-distracted-by-war "https\://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-28/azerbaijan-armenia-tensions-surge-with-russia-distracted-by-war")  This week, we will hear about the war and the recent tensions from Bakhtiyar Neyman, an active member of the [Azerbaijan Cultural Society of Northern California](https://www.acsnc.org/ "https\://www.acsnc.org/").  Bring your questions about the war, as well as on Azerbaijan in general.  Bakhtiyar plans to talk about:

1. Brief historic overview of the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict.
2. The 1988-1994 active phase.
3. Developments during the frozen phase of 1994-2020
4. Tovuz incident of July 2020.
5. Military aspects of the 44-day war (in 2020).
6. International involvement during the 44-day war.
7. Human rights violations during the 44-day war.
8. The way forward.

In addition to the usual pizza, we will have a homemade Moroccan soup called [harira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harira "https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harira"), courtesy of Samy Meftoul.  Samy is a Moroccan PCC student who gave a talk at our club and helped organize a joint event with Pi Club.  He'll follow his mom's recipe in order to make as traditional a dish as possible, so make sure to come taste it!
