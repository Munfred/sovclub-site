Another week, another bunch of terrible things. [The liberals admit defeat](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/underlying-conditions/610261/). [China finishes the job.](https://hongkongfp.com/2020/04/20/explainer-beijings-5-day-crackdown-on-hong-kongs-opposition-during-covid-19/) [Modi can't do the job](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52360757). Trumponaro attends anti-democracy rally and [coughs on manifestants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvolmvQmmQg&feature=emb_logo) (like a lot lol). [Singapore has fallen](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-singapore-moh-new-cases-apr-22-10000-dormitory-12665430).



At Sovclub we pride ourselves in our smug, knee-jerk, ill-or-over-informed responses to any political event, past, present, future, hypothetical, or just happening in a parallel multiverse. Sometimes these even evolve into rants, and you know, like they say, its a pity to let a good rant go to waste. Especially now when everyone has too much time to rant on their hands.



So recently at sovchat*, while reminiscing about all those wasted rants, it hit us. Paraphrasing Austin: *"Sovblog. Like [Caltech Letters](https://caltechletters.org/), but for confusing over-informed political rants"*. Incidentally, [Netlify makes it rather straightforward to create a static blog that is recompiled every time you push to GitHub](https://templates.netlify.com/tags/blog/).



And so it was born: [https://blog.​caltechsovereignty.club/](https://blog.caltechsovereignty.club/)

We are, of course, inviting contributions from anyone, saying anything, ideally about countries, but also stuff.



See you tonight, 6PM cartime, 8PM indiantime, 9PM puritantime, 10PM bananatime, 9AM Saturday duriantime, 6:30AM bollywoodtime. (yes, Raj said he might make this heroic effort to bestow upon us the honour of his presence and the latest of India)
