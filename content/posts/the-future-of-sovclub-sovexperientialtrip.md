Peaceful constitutional transitions are always challenging, especially when it is an autocracy with no clear succession line. Especially after being displaced to cyberspace by an ongoing pandemic, now needs to grapple with the fact that everyone is graduating.



Yes. Sovclub now faces a real succession crisis.



We like bureaucracy for the sake of bureaucracy, art for art's sake, and we like being a real club. To that end, we must abide by the legal framework laid out by the [Caltech club's handbook](https://ore.caltech.edu/documents/18814/Club_Handbook_2021.04.22.pdf), and besides an approved [constitution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2KZgRUbrxrfKcA5IiHkxdEK2Oe729vmSVcqMzSMovs/edit), we need a **President**, a **Secretary** (of state) and a **Treasurer**. All of which are up for grabs.



Do you aspire power? Are your wildest dreams to nominally run sovclub? Then come to sovcall tonight at 6PM and we can make that a reality! [https://caltech.zoom.us/my/​sovcall](https://caltech.zoom.us/my/sovcall)



**Additionally, for all those vaccinated who are up for an adventure, Brener and I have a message to share, for an experiential trip to take place sometime in late November or December (everything TBD):**

*\
Since the borders are finally open for fully vaccinated travelers there is a great opportunity to hop on a plane and come check out Trudeau land, near the Calgary mountains for 3 days or so. The idea is to have a celebratory retreat in a nice cabin, preferably with a hot tub where we can meet in person, discuss cool things, experience the Brazilian ways, nature and the Cosmos chaperoned by me, Eduardo and my Brazilian Buddy Lucas. Estimated cost (except for airfare) would be $300-500. If interested, come to sovcall.*



Cheers
