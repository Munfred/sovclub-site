This Wednesday, Roman Korol, an Ukrainian graduate student, will tell us about the Ukraine/Russia conflict.Â  A Russian student, our own LeonidÂ Pereiaslov, will join the discussion.Â  Hopefully we'll have a lively but respectful session!Â  Roman's summary:

*"Ukraine vs Russiaâ€¦ what happened there and what to expect next? Since the Soviet Union collapsed around 1990, Ukraine and Russia maintained friendly relationship. That is until 2014. Russian annexation of the Crimea peninsula came as a surprise to most Ukrainians, both 'pro- and anti- Russia'. After almost 8 years of the 'stealthy war', Russia seems to be ready to invade according to NATO intelligence. Is this a show of force, a preparation of a full-fledged attack, or a gross exaggeration of the threat, as perceived by NATO?"*
