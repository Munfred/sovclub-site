I motion to call constitutional convention tonight during regular meeting time, to amend [our constitution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2KZgRUbrxrfKcA5IiHkxdEK2Oe729vmSVcqMzSMovs/edit?usp=sharing) in a constitutionally sound way. Feel free to propose any amendments that tickle your fancy too.



That is because the gap between bananatime and cartime is now 5 hours, putting the sacred time of 6PM cartime at 11PM bananatime. Given the propensity of our meetings to run...forever, I would like to get bullshit time started at 5PM cartime instead of 6PM.

 

But *Article 6., Section Bullshit* states that bullshit cannot take place before 6PM. So to formally keep the bullshit we'd need a constitutional amendment, which by definition can only be voted on after bullshit but before 7PM cartime. Austin also proposed a bunch of constitutional amendments, which should be voted on. And we need a new voting system. If you come up with anything, we'll pass it. Bonus points if it's worse than the American system,



In sovereignty
