In this special session of Sovereignty Club, hosted jointly with [Caltech Hillel](https://hillel.clubs.caltech.edu/ "https\://hillel.clubs.caltech.edu/"), Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center rabbi [John Carrier](https://www.pjtc.net/biorabbijohncarrierspeaker "https\://www.pjtc.net/biorabbijohncarrierspeaker") will tell us about the beliefs and history of Judaism.  His talk is entitled "What Judaism Is, What It Isn’t, and What It Can Be”.  Have questions that you were afraid to ask?  This is your chance, because I asked John to leave at least 30 minutes for questions.  

This meeting is part of our World Religions series, where we invite clergy from the world's most influential religions to tell us about their faith.  There will be free vegan and non-vegan pizza, drinks, and alcohol.
