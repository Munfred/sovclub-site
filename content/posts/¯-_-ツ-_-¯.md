Yeah. We're having a meeting tonight, at the usual time, at the usual link: [https://caltech.zoom.us/​j/4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668). I just don't know what it will be about.



I'm (only mildly) sorry. Due to a combination of factors (meaning, everything that happened between last Wednesday and now), I didn't get to [read enough about mechanism design](http://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=18AF3A835BE1A31D5A7A66E3209D2E9E) to be happy about presenting on it just yet.



So! **You** have a mission: find some tidbit you'd like to talk about, and bring it to the meeting. It's going to be bullshit from beginning to end, and beyond. Feel free to email it to the club by replying to this email.



On a separate note: I'm giving a virtual 10 min talk at [Explore Caltech today 5PM](http://explore.caltech.edu/events/explore-caltech-talks-88374) cartime, so if for some reason I'm late *do not panic*. I'm probably just being overwhelmed with fame and adulation.



Cheers



Eduardo
