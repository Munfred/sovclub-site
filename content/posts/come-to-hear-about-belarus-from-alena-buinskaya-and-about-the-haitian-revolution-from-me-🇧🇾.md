I was supposed to present on the Haitian Revolution, but our guest speaker, Alena Buinskaya, captivated us for 3 hours by talking about the politics and history of Belarus.Â  If anyone wants to tell us about the politics or history of \*their\* country, especially if it's a dictatorship that's persecuting them, I'm happy to delay my presentation another week.
