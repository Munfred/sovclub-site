Lebanese student Alya Al-Kibbi will tell us about her country:

*"For my talk, I plan to explain the current Lebanese economic crisis. I will provide some historical background and an explanation of the political issues that led to the hyper inflation we see today, I will also be talking about the role of social unrest in shaping the countryâ€™s development over the past few years. I plan to provide a personal account of the effects of the economic crisis on the day to day lives of the people living there. Iâ€™m really excited about it all!"*
