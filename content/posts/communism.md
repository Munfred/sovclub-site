[A spectre is haunting Sovereignty Club](https://imgur.com/a/VR4ToMG) - the Spectre of [Communism](https://books.google.com/books/about/Manifesto_of_the_Communist_Party.html?id=s2iEeCJAlusC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false). All the powers of Sovereignty Club have entered an alliance to exorcise this spectre; [the President and the Secretary](https://imgur.com/a/Fw7G5DQ), [the visitors and the regulars](https://imgur.com/a/GMdbqyH), [the near and the far](https://imgur.com/a/32xlWcg).

But [by the ruling class's own doing](https://imgur.com/a/2aAF6n9), communism is here to speak, this Wednesday at 6PM in BBB B101, the People's Lounge.

To prepare ourselves for the discussion, we must ask ourselves, is there even anything wrong about the current systems in the first place? The Manifesto has some things to say:

* "In these crises there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity - [the epidemic of over-production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFGH55fjBvI)"
* "If anywhere \[the proletarians] unite to form more compact bodies, this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of the union of the bourgeoisie... thus the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie... [the bourgeoisie itself... furnishes the proletariat with the weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie](https://imgur.com/a/98MGVYb)."
* "All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the [immense majority.](https://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2018/09/FT_18.09.05_Middle-Income_2.png)"
* "The modern labourer, ..., instead of rising with the progress of industry, [sinks deeper](https://i2.wp.com/www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Reeves-93income-share.png?w=768&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1) and [deeper](https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20180113_FBC512.png) below the conditions of existence of his own class."

The most important topic of Wednesday's discussion will be: what exactly is this spectre "communism"? [Widely confused with socialism](https://stream.org/on-communism-and-socialism-many-americans-are-still-clueless/), [even by the world's leaders](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/do-you-know-the-difference-between-a-communist-and-a-socialist-a6708086.html), tainted by Russia, China, and other nations' purported [attempts at communism](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/marxist-dreams-soviet-realities), and filled with [anti-communism propaganda from around the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ncfzcz9QkOw&list=PL2e3ox67uXXBIPpiRmuin36F0avv8cJ88), it is understandable why people have the wrong idea.

But, at its core, what is it? According to Marx and Engels: "the theory of the Communists can be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property"

"Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property!" You might say. But the Communist Manifesto does not claim to do away with all concept of personal belongings, but rather says your property is already gone for 90% of the population (the proletariat), and "Communism deprives no \[person] of the power to appropriate the products of society: all that it does is deprive \[people] of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriation."

And with that, I look forward to a fun discussion this Wednesday!
