What do you do when you got one of the most unequal countries on earth with a legacy of slavery and one of largest populations in the world that urbanized far too quickly and disorderly? A country where a majority of the population lives in a state of exclusion, marginalization and disenfranchisement? A country so unequal that every city is a fractal pattern of islets of affluence surrounded by misery?\
\
One thing you could do is move to a community in the heart of this urban exclusion to understand what it truly means. Then you could spend four decades listening to people, befriending them, helping them, coordinating them and pressuring the government for enfranchisement through assertive non-aggressive dialogue. At the same time you could create and boost a network of civic organizations to create the social reality you really want to see, without waiting on the government or someone else to do it for you, reaching tens of thousands of people. You could focus on youth and education, for education enables creating economic opportunities and paves the way for social inclusion. Education also enables shaping the values of a growing generation, and you could use it to upregulate the values you think are important for the society you want to create. These could include valuing workers and teachers, valuing grassroots participatory democracy, valuing a civic and engaged mindset, and valuing that everything in life is very interdependent, that you should care not only about treating people well, but also the environment.\
\
Then you could utilize all those decades of experience working in the harshest of social realities implementing educational programs for several thousands of youth to create a bold and practical vision for the future of education. You could look towards what is necessary to create an inclusive knowledge economy, and an inclusive society. An innovative approach for lifelong education that blends teaching technical skills with socio-emotional learnings and puts that in the context of day to day life in community and in society. You could start by implementing that as an after-hours program that can nimbly iterate and refine innovative approaches that work, aiming to set an example to resoundingly successful that educational organizations across the country will soon copy that progra. And you could have such a stellar team of educators working with you that you begin implementing this program to hundreds of youth before the pandemic is even over.\
\
Then you could bump into a crazy Caltech grad student that understands this vision and your team’s ability to execute for what it is, and goes amok exhorting everyone and trying to get the resources for you to do much more, much faster.\

This Wednesday at 6PM Eduardo will tell the story of Vilson Groh, a Catholic priest who did and is doing just that. Eduardo just came back from a month-long anthropological immersion and institutional deep dive with Vilson and the network or organizations he helped create and coordinate. Eduardo has been supporting them in implementing this vision for over a year, from California. Eduardo is really fucking impressed.\
\
Eduardo is now working on a longform written article telling some of Vilson's story and vision. You are welcome to comment on it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_sp_Re1SO0eZfoxaCtPCwO6GulDJU8zJ02OTpN-J-KM/edit?usp=sharing), bearing in my it is still an early draft (and if you know suitable publication venues, let him know)\
