Tonight we will talk about an underappreciated aspect that exacerbates virtually everything about the world: There is a lot of people out there. A **lot** more than there used to be a very short time ago. Consider these timepoints from the graph below taken from the[ Future Population Growth](https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth) article of Our World in Data (and if this tickled your fancy, see also their [World Population Growth article](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth))



2050 - 9.7B

2020 - 7.8B

1987 - 5B

1950 - 2.5B (Over the next 37 years it would DOUBLE! Less than two generations!)

1928 - 2B (i.e. 100 years ago we had FOUR times less people)

1803 - 1B

1700 - 0.6B

That big spike in the pink growth line - it coincides with the making of the modern geopolitical world. Sure, it is wars, genocides, the fall of empires, ethnonationalism and all those other terrible things we learned to love that *shapes* the world, but what *drives* them?

\
As you may recall from [one of our very first meetings](https://www.caltechsovereignty.club/sovereignty-club-this-wednesday-oct-24-at-pm-on-bbb-b101-%F0%9F%9A%A9%F0%9F%9A%A9%F0%9F%9A%A9), we wondered why did countries stop selling pieces of themselves to each other - the last such purchase was in 1916 when the US bought the [US Virgin Islands from the Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_West_Indies) (known until then as [Danish West Indies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_the_Danish_West_Indies)). Why did they stop? It really kinda just stopped happening, but changing borders and territorial claims kept on being very much still a thing, although primarily bartered with violence rather than money and goods.



The best explanation we could concoct - the only one - was that country stopped selling their land because it was becoming *too valuable to sell* because there were simply more people. So they have to fight over it. And taking populated land is also much harder - remember that back in the day you [could just go talk to the Pope and he'd split the New World half and half between you and your cousin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tordesillas)



So a growing population might directly cause land political ownership - sovereignty! - to become increasingly static. Empires stop expanding, their borders stop changing all the time, people create a sense of identity tied to the land they are sitting in, rather than just who's the current overlord. Tie that with cultural identity and you get ethnonationalism, the fall of empires, the rise of nation states as a fashionable thing, coupled with all the problems they have to deal with. Not saying any of that is causal, but, maybe.



What else do *you* think is driven by the sheer number of people around?

\- [Urbanization](https://ourworldindata.org/urbanization)? In the 1960s urban/rural populations were 1B/2B, vs 4B/3.5B now. 

\- [Alleviation of Poverty?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_poverty) With more people to produce things and everyone concentrated in cities, much efficiency from specialization can be derived, so everyone has more stuff. Or maybe it was all just thanks to technology.

\- [Inequality?](https://ourworldindata.org/global-economic-inequality) I won't even hazard a mechanistic explanation. I'll just point out that if you check the first plot from that link, the fraction of high income people is decreasing, and the fraction of low income is increasing....
