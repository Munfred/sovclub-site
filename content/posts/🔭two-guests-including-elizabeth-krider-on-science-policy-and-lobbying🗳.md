Hello sovclubers,



Today, for the first time in sovclub history, we have TWO guests (!!)  One is a lady from the [Foresight Institute](https://foresight.org/about/our-mission/ "https\://foresight.org/about/our-mission/") who somehow really liked [our website](https://www.caltechsovereignty.club/ "https\://www.caltechsovereignty.club/") and was determined to check us out.  Another is our guest speaker, [Elizabeth Krider](https://www.oak-crest.org/board/elizabeth-krider/ "https\://www.oak-crest.org/board/elizabeth-krider/"), who I met on a hiking trail last weekend.  Krider used to be Caltech's science lobbyist, and is now an independent consultant on science policy and academic research issues.  She'll tell us how to make people like us and give us money so that ~~![☢](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/2622)️we form our own country and take over the world![🌍](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f30d)~~~~![🌎](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f30e)~~ continue toiling for the good of humanity.



Have any crazy ideas about how science should be done?  Bring them.  Don't have any crazy ideas?  Come listen to Krider say reasonable things instead, in a break with sovclub tradition.



See you today at [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668), 6PM PST!

P.S. Elizabeth, you're welcome to either join at 6:30 pm, or join at 6:00 pm and stay for the bullshit period.  No pressure either way.
