Last week: the fickleness of revolutionary France sparks a civil war in Saint Domingue, with whites revolting against the metropole, coloreds revolting against whites, and slaves revolting against everyone else.Â  Le Cap burns to the ground, and the British and Spanish invade, the latter allying with the slaves.Â  In desperate need of allies, French commissioners Sonthonax & Polverel free the slaves.

Â 

This week:Â  Ex-slave Toussaint Louverture rises to power.Â  Napoleon invades.Â  Former field slave Dessalines consolidates anti-French resistance.Â  Independence, then dictatorship.

Â 

Come hear about part 2 of 2 (or 3?) of the Haitian Revolution this Wednesday:Â [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/â€‹4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668).Â  World events discussion 6:00--6:30; presentation 6:30--7:30.
