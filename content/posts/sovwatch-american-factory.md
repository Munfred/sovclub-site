Following a great idea from this week’s sovcall, I want to invite everyone for sovwatch this Saturday at 5pm cartime: watching a movie together apart using Netflix Party to sync streams. Get it set up here: <https://www.netflixparty.com/>. If you want to participate let me know, so we don’t get started without you.



We will be watching the Netflix fiction fantasy drama “American Factory”, which tells the story of a teenage 243-year-old country reaching puberty post industrial development, and its struggles coming to grips with boys the offshoring of its industrial base because its currency is too expensive and it’s people too pampered, compounded by some deep running schizophrenia.



The story focuses on the developing relationship of young America with China, an older boy country with a proud and different culture that lives is far away, and which America struggles to understand. [Growing up, America had a cold, at times uneasy relationship with China](https://history.state.gov/countries/issues/china-us-relations), at times forcefully rebuking it’s advances immigration waves that developing America had trouble coping with.



The ice begins to thaw during America’s pre-teen pre-war years, but with hormones revolutions raging, they again argue and a deeply butthurt McCarthyan America turns to China’s younger brother, Taiwan, in the hopes of sparking jealousy in older China. But China, ever too proud to open up to America, takes off with Soviet Russia, an older girl country with bad habits whose only interest in China was as a sexual geopolitical sub.



Despite being older, China’s heart political alignment is shattered by Russia’s indifference, and it again begins to wander. Meanwhile America, ever jealous of older Russia, reapproches China. Time however, only made it’s feelings military and economic ties with young Taiwan grow, and they both struggle to reconcile China within their lives geopolitical strategies.



After consulting with Taiwan, America timidly approaches China, and proposes polyamorous marriage on a dual household with two houses but one family two(three? four?) systems with one China policy. Estranged by Russia’s abandonment, China opens up it’s feelings economy to America. Timidly at first, but with rapidly growing passion exports, America and China become increasingly sexually economically interwinted, with Taiwan jumping in for threeways multilateral trade.



But building a committed long term relationship is hard. America thought China could change, that it could bond with sell bonds to China, and that through sexual economic intercourse, by helping China develop emotionally economically, that China would also mature in it’s drinking problem human rights record. Alas. Proud China refused to change its ways, its interest in America being strictly sexual economic. America, having espousing the avant-garde kind of polyamorous neoliberal philosophy that is all the rage in Sillicon Valley the West these days, thought that all the sex trade was fine and dandy, but it wanted more. Yet China wouldn’t give.



Their relationship reaches a boiling point when America accuses China of not doing oral unfair trade practices, threatening to withhold sex trade altogether. Caught in the crossfire, young Taiwan, not being gay communist, sides with America, and tensions rapidly escalate. Now divorce nuclear holocaust is a real option. What will happen? Let’s find out!



Join us this Satuday 5pm cartime, and let’s find out! Don’t forget to set up Netflix Party to sync streams, so get it: <https://www.netflixparty.com/>

PS: I think I created a new genre of historical satire. I call it “geopolitical history, but narrated as a cheap teenage romance drama movie”



PSS: And if you think that was derpy, check out [this painting that Austin](https://dailysatori.wordpress.com/2013/07/09/liu-yis-beijing-2008/) pointed out to me…



PSSS: If you don’t have Netflix, hit me up. I know a guy.
