Due to global heating ⚗️, the emoji fields 🗂️ experienced a crippling crop failure👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 👨‍🏭🚠.  As a result the sovclub email🖨️ for this week as been delayed till the last minute 🕢 and only bottom💾 tier 🇰🇵 emojis 🈁 were available 📪 to be included 🗄️.  It is literally a starvation🗜️ situation 📇. 

Anyhow, join us as we complete 🗃️ our interrupted 🇬🇬  discussion ⛎ about the possible futures of the Earth system🧥, examining different RCPs🚝 and assessing their likelihood📤.

You know where it is! 18:00 Pacific time, https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668
