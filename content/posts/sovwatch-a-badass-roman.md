This week Michael told us about a roman so badass that when he got kidnapped by pirates he befriended them, taught them philosophy, berated them for deeming to price of his rescue too low, then promised he'd hunt them down and crucify them (like Brian, Jesus, and all the other non citizens) and actually followed up on his promise.



So tonight we will watching episode 1 of the BBC series Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire, which talks about Julius Cesar, who needs no further introduction.
