🧮 📚📖 🖍️ **Education and Technology** part 1/n* 📲📱💻🖨️👨‍💻



I write these words with two lofty goals:



i) To communicate effectively across languages, cultures, and epistemic bubbles, especially in the Americas*.



ii) To be genuinely heard and understood by a wide range of people. I want to make the concerns I share here relatable to people working with education, people working with technology, and people who make decisions that affect other people, in the public and private realms. But I especially want to reach those who care about their societies and care about other people. I hope that is you.



In caring about people and society there are an endless number of concerns, and it is true that the squeaky wheel gets the grease: our attention and resources. I have become convinced that education, and its interplay with a constantly changing technological environment, is just about the faintest of the wheels, yet perhaps the most consequential. In the western world this has been visibly the case for the past two centuries, but the confluence of technology and education (especially pre-university education) is seldom something we think about or see being discussed.



The way we behave and the way we think is a direct consequence of the education we got growing up (much more than university education, which typically provides tools, knowledge and connections that build upon those existing patterns of thoughts and behaviors). And the way we choose to leverage technology and allow our lives, cities and societies to be changed by it is entirely a matter of how we think - about ourselves, about other people, and about how technology as a tool can be used to create the lives we want.



What I have come to realize, with growing concern, is that over the past century the elements that we consider to belong to the technical and technology have become almost fully divorced from those that we consider to belong to the human and humanities. Self described technologists abound (I am one), but how often would they also self describe as humanists?



**A Manifesto**



Over the past century, the rate of technological change has been such that societies could not think critically about how these new tools and technologies should be used and taught within their existing human processes, values, and culture. This is especially true of educational systems.



The speed of change, especially over the past 20 years with the internet, social media and omnipresent smartphones, has left educators across the globe bewildered and struggling to adapt.



Countries across the world have left their educational systems going on autopilot while being swept by successive waves of new technologies that dramatically change the behaviors and ways of thinking of people in a society - the very things educational systems are designed to shape.



The encyclopedist model of education, such as is the case for Brazilian education, is completely bankrupt and obsolete. This has been the case for decades, but now it is painfully impossible to ignore. For example: ChatGPT is better than the overwhelming majority of students coming out of brazilian high-school. That is because the Brazilian system does not form critical students, it prizes memorization and repetition. This is the case across many societies, but I am most familiar with Brazilian reality and that is where I can speak the most about and feel the most ability to directly impact. I believe these concerns and solutions generalize a lot, especially across Latin America.



We literally need a new kind of education that is focused on forming critical students, but with deep awareness not only of the social contexts of Brazil but of the inhumanely fast technology changes that have been happening. In the past 10 years Whatsapp and Instagram swept Brazil and changed how everyone communicates and behaves. The next 10 years are gonna be even faster and nobody is thinking about these things, let alone in terms of education.



The thing is the technology people do not care about education. These are the folks pushing the technologies changing the dynamics of societies across the globe, but with little idea or concern for how they actually affect societies across cultures. When there is concern, it manifests with very ill conceived notions of human nature, to the point of it sounding like a satire.



On the other side you have pedagogues, teachers, psychologists, social assistants and people that do the hard, fundamental, and very often unrecognized work of human development, with little understanding about technology, and often treating it uncritically as a black box -- with students absorbing that attitude.



Given the speed of development of AI, language models and image generators being applied to selling you customized ads (images created by the AI to entice you, words and sounds created on the fly to get you to do things) I am very concerned that in the next 10 years we risk with very high chance of going from the attention economy to the mindless economy. This will be slavery 3.0 but we won't even notice it.

As a result probably >95% of the 8B brains we have around will be devoted to doing the bids of the machines that have been programmed by a handful of executives to inflate their revenues and their egos. Humankind will become even more of a mass of undeveloped humans zombified into propping up rent seeking schemes that through individual pettiness create collective misery.



The only society that clearly recognizes this threat and is acting cohesively to avoid, even if with an ethics that is largely anathema to the west, is China. For good and bad their chief ideologue Wang Huning has a very critical view of the western and especially American way of life, and they are taking very strong handed measures to not let their society sleepwalk into the dystopia described above (it might likely be another kind of dystopia, I'm fairly convinced that unless the regime hollows from the within and Taiwan takes over mainland, China is Nazism 3.0 with the lessons learned from the fall of the Nazis and the soviets).



I am concerned not just because of the speed of technology change and our track record of mindless adoption. Not just because I have been witnessing first hand all the time, in classrooms and across Brazilian society how it acts as a kind of mind cancer that prevents people and students from being able to stop and actually think, and how it makes everyone anxious and unable to be present. But I am especially concerned because I have had the privilege to witness first hand the minds, egos and ethos of the culture pushing that. The prevailing technology people ethos does not concern itself with human nature\*\*. The prevailing mindset is that technology alone fixes everything, and it is dumbfounded by the challenge of creating sustainable human processes, which requires the thing technology people have the least: patience.





*The Need for a Critical Pedagogy of Technology*

\
I believe the only way forward to maintain thinkings societies in countries with nominal democracies and a semblance of functional institutions with a new educational synthesis, primarily targeted to youth from birth to pre-university, when brains and behaviors are most pliable, implemented iteratively as it is conceived, both because we cannot afford to wait and because the ground keeps changing beneath our feet.

For lack of a better name I'm thinking of it as "critical pedagogy of technology and society". In very simple terms: we need to teach educators about technology, such that they themselves have a critical framework on which to make sense and best utilize these black boxes they deal with everyday, and with which to impart youth and students. At the same time we need to teach technologists about pedagogy and society. For example, we have plenty of open minded technologists that care about society, but never had the chance to interact much with people from humanities who go really deep into dealing with human nature and having other frameworks to think about it.



\
*The Brazilian motivation and educational ethos*

\
Brazil is a Catholic hierarchical society built on slavery, as is the rest of Latin America. This is reflected in the way the education system was designed, with a heavy encyclopedist emphasis: the teacher is the authority who transmits information to students, and a good student is one who can absorb and regurgitate that information accurately. This has always been the case, and this is an accurate description of the vast majority of schools and classrooms in Brazil and Latin America.\
\
This depressing reality is immediately clear to any critical observer who comes into direct contact with educational practices in Brazil. Richard Feynman loved not only Caltech, he also loved Brazil and visited very often, as described his experiences with Brazilian education ina chapter of “Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!”, which I highlight below (full text here: [http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=6f8c9fb72b&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!7EAW-MXynx_YLI0JGNK8CX5aNrMIezT4In7Jml-JeZapiS1TllDZ9tvh0o26rq8l-tP101BalDUq1xpff287ncecnkh_GQ$))

*“In regard to education in Brazil, I had a very interesting experience. I was teaching a group of students who would ultimately become teachers, since at that time there were not many opportunities in Brazil for a highly trained person in science.”*

*\[...]*

*“Everything was entirely memorized, yet nothing had been translated into meaningful words.”*

*\[...]*

*“So, you see, they could pass the examinations, and “learn” all this stuff, and not know anything at all, except what they had memorized.”*

*\[...]*

*“One other thing I could never get them to do was to ask questions. Finally, a student explained it to me: “If I ask you a question during the lecture, afterwards everybody will be telling me, ‘What are you wasting our time for in the class? We’re trying to learn something. And you’re stopping him by asking a question’.”*



I assure you his statements remain accurate: I started my undergraduate studies in chemistry in Brazil, and years later (after I had transferred to the US and majored in biophysics) a friend from freshman year remarked “yeah everyone hated you, because you’d always ask questions in every class”. Fortunately I was too socially aloof to notice that and be hindered by it.

Feynman was describing higher education in Brazil, but pre-university education is a far worse catastrophe, whose victims are unable to scream, for they can barely grasp the magnitude of the tragedy being inflicted upon them: the tragedy of a life of mental conformism, of inability to see or understand the water in which they swim, of lack of agency, confidence, and meek uncritical acceptance of all which is imposed upon them.

[Paulo Freire](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=0847e36100&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!7EAW-MXynx_YLI0JGNK8CX5aNrMIezT4In7Jml-JeZapiS1TllDZ9tvh0o26rq8l-tP101BalDUq1xpff287ncc5YnNKVw$) was a brazilian educator who grew up in poverty and hunger. In the 1960s over 40% of people in Brazil were illiterate. Freire developed an extremely effective literacy method which he used to teach peasants how to read based on his “critical pedagogy” educational philosophy, first described in his 1968 book “Pedagogy of the Oppressed”. A few years later when there was a military coup Freire was jailed and exiled for being left leaning. Afterwards he became a professor at Harvard, and his method has been widely used across the world.



Nowadays Freire is widely acknowledged in Brazil, but his ideas and methods were never broadly implemented in Brazilian education - precisely the phenomenon Feynman described in his memoir.

Freire’s critical method also avoided the malaise of “functional illiteracy”, where people are able to read but unable to leverage reading beyond very basic tasks.



With the sweeping waves of technological change in an increasingly digital world, Brazil, Latin America, and every developing country faces a similar kind of challenge: the vast majority of people are “digitally illiterate” or functionally so. Because technology changed so fast, our educational systems did not evolve to reflect that and teach people about using the technology they have at their grasp, let alone doing so critically. As a result we have the dehumanizing dystopia that is the attention economy, we treat the very thing that makes us human - our agency, attention, time, thought, our ability to reason - as a commodity to be manipulated by interests far beyond our own. With AI being mindlessly deployed under the same ethos, this dehumanization process is likely to worsen a lot in the next few years.



I believe a way to avoid that scenario is to develop such a “critical pedagogy of technology” that parallels Freire’s “critical pedagogy”. The myriad of educational programs worldwide leveraging Freire’s philosophy to teach people of all ages to read and think critically about society suggests the same should be possible with regards to technology, with children and adults alike.

\
\
*Change is possible*



The twist is that I am far from resigned or hopeless, despite the despondency that may sometimes tinge my words. Because of the receptivity I see when discussing these ideas with educators in Brazil and the US, I think it is possible to have significant educational overhauls in less than a generation and avoid another dehumanizing catastrophe, certainly in the Americas. That is because in the US there is already notable momentum in education along these lines, and in Latin America the more centralized nature of the political system means significant systemic policy changes can happen at a pace unthinkable in the US. But for changes to be implemented widely at the speed required it is necessary to galvanize people around these concerns, not just educators. With these writings I am trying to contribute to that galvanization through clear communication and reflection.



*The practical experiences behind all these rants*



These words do not come from just pie in the sky wishful thinking isolated reflection, they are motivated by practical experiences. Those that know me know that I strongly supporting the [Pode Crer program](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=34484bcf70&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!7EAW-MXynx_YLI0JGNK8CX5aNrMIezT4In7Jml-JeZapiS1TllDZ9tvh0o26rq8l-tP101BalDUq1xpff287ncfFmRvfWg$), which brings innovative education in technology, civics and leadership tailored to Brazilian vulnerable marginalized youth. It was created by the Vilson Groh Institute ([https://vilsongroh.org](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=8cf66acb3d&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!7EAW-MXynx_YLI0JGNK8CX5aNrMIezT4In7Jml-JeZapiS1TllDZ9tvh0o26rq8l-tP101BalDUq1xpff287nceVUNR8Vg$)) which has a 40-year history of grassroots work in education in marginalized communities, and with which I became heavily involved.



Pode Crer is an innovative complementary education program and teaching methodology created to be effective with vulnerable youth from Brazilian marginalized communities, developing their technical and socio-emotional skills to participate in the creative knowledge economy. We are using the Florianópolis region as a testing ground for refining Pode Crer into an example that can be replicated across Brazil. Over 2021 and 2022 we piloted this program with 620 student spots, and in two years over 850 youth ages 11-24 were served, of which 529 completed the program, a 61% completion rate, and 25% of students 14+ have gotten good opportunities after the program.



These numbers are remarkable because Pode Crer has no selection criteria besides low income , being open to all youth in poor families making less than 1.5x minimum wage per capita in Brazil ($390/mo), and reaches the poorest of the poor in the most challenging social contexts of Brazilian cities. If you are not yet tired of reading about Pode Crer, see the 2022 report at [https://vilsongroh.org/2022report.pdf](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://vilsongroh.org/2022report.pdf__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!7EAW-MXynx_YLI0JGNK8CX5aNrMIezT4In7Jml-JeZapiS1TllDZ9tvh0o26rq8l-tP101BalDUq1xpff287ncfCSiuQew$) and a 33-slide deck [here](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=f558573007&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!7EAW-MXynx_YLI0JGNK8CX5aNrMIezT4In7Jml-JeZapiS1TllDZ9tvh0o26rq8l-tP101BalDUq1xpff287nceL-7zzkw$).

*\*the reason why this is an N part series is because Eduardo is planning to start an blog in English/Portuguese/Spanish on the topic of education and technology, and he will occasionally take advantage of sovclub’s captive audience to have a souding board. Congratulations, you’ve been made an intellectual hostage.*



\*\*Here is a FANTASTIC article arguing for technologists that care about human nature, aptly titled “"Technological Humanism”
