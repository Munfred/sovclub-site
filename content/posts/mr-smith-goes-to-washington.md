To our new conscripts: hello! We hope to one day see you, rather than just spam your inbox.\
\
We meet every Wednesday at 6PM cartime on this zoom link: [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)\
\
But since *The Great Lockdown™* started we've been bored and longing for attention, so we started *sovwatch*™ where every Saturday we meet at 5pm cartime* to watch a movie about politics, or diplomacy, or the lack of it.



Tonight we're watching the 1939 classic [Mr. Smith Goes to Washington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpJSB4Gbljc), which depicts what might have happened had Dylan not chickened out and actually ran for congress.\
\
So if you can't wait until Wednesday and want to watch a movie in 50 minutes, join us at [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)\
\
See you soon!\
\
Eduardo
