This is part 2 of 2 on the demographic future of humanity.Â  This week, Tracy will give the talk, and Brener willÂ join the discussion.Â  Tracy is aÂ Caltech professor of Social Science History, who taught a class on demographics last quarter.Â  She is also our club's advisor.

Tracy's talk:

*Why is fertility dropping so rapidly almost everywhere in the world? Is this a trend we should worry about? Last week Brener offered a biological account. This week's presentation provides a historical and social/economic perspective on these questions. We'll talk about why many of the things weÂ **think**â€‹ we know about population history are wrong. Do you imagine that late marriage and nuclear families are a modern post-industrial phenomenon? That's not true. Do you assume that fertility decline began with introduction of reliable contraception? Also wrong. We'll cover all this and more in this week's talk: from Malthus to modernity in under 30 minutes. There will be lots to discuss!*
