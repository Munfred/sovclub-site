As we prepare for the 13 hour flight back from our investigative trip, and assuming Dylan hasn't completely overturned the power structure at Sovereignty club, me and Valentine sift through the many pictures and lessons in comparative politics from this trip, already longing for the ubiquitous Asian food stalls.



In a world's first, I'll keep this email short. Join us at Sovereignty Lounge, BBB B101 this Wednesday 6pm to see some of the pictures we have from Singapore and Hong Kong and look at them side by side!
