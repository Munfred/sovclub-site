The pandemic has normalized a new kind of liquidity. The total equivalence - for ***\*everyone\****, not just avant-garde technologists - that what you see on your computer screen is every bit as real as things surrounding you that you can touch and smell.



The (geopolitical) implications are every bit as dramatic as the end of the cold war.



Not since a time before modern countries - 1800s Europe is what I picture, a time when travel was generally unimpeded ([as long as you are moneyed enough to do it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Tour)) and the notion of nationality was fluid - have we as humankind experienced such mental fluidity in whom we can transact with.



World War I dramatically ended that idyllic state of affairs, spurred the birth of the modern nation state, and left the writing on the wall for any aspiring fledgling empire (sorry, America).



World War II consolidated that, the fatal blow to the concept of mindless territorial expansion, burying it as both outdated (why fight wars to grab colonies when you can sign trade agreements?) and totally unsustainable (my heart goes out to you, #bestempire). In the midst of the Cambrian explosion of nation states caused by the swift disintegration of remaining empires, the next best thing to do was just grab some strategically located isles around the world while leaving to figure out government by themselves.



And, as swiftly as this myriad of new borders sprang into the reality accepted by people, they were enforced. In a world with fresh, vivid, scathing, traumatizing memories of TWO global wars spaced TWENTY years apart, and with two superpowers ready to blow each other up and everyone else along  with them, it made total sense to be wary. That nothing more terrible than communism happened is kind of extraordinary.



In retrospect, what is perhaps not so extraordinary is that this insane, unsustainable, divide kind of… poof, magically went away overnight on its own, given the recurring trend of everything happening more  faster bigger as we rumble towards the singularity. 



What happened since then is all that we (the people that show up to sovclub) have ever known: as a [flower  child](https://www.caltechsovereignty.club/something-is-happening), I have only known a world that is stable, at peace, with immutable borders, and on which you can go pretty much anywhere you want to and do whatever you want, [as long as you are moneyed enough to do it](https://www.google.com/travel/flights).



We came full circle. Two hot and one cold wars later, we have a global geopolitical reality that mimics the 1800s, with the added enhancer that being moneyed enough is easier than ever.



But then the pandemic hit. Right after we got used to the internet. And now everyone believes that the internet and reality are one and the same. And because everyone believes that, it is now reality.



We thought we’d need VR to get people to equate the digital world with the real world. Turns out one year of home arrest works just as well.



We. Are. Done. Our beloved Kevin Rudd had predicted that [With the wrong decisions, the 2020s will look like a mindless rerun of the 1930s; the right decisions, however, could pull us back from the abyss](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tZqD16Bq1E5Xgzoieost955F6Rmp8Z9x/view?usp=sharing). He was hoping multiple world leaders would think different and “make the right decisions”. Well guess what. The whole world, every person, my grandmother, now thinks and acts differently.



It does not matter how [“dense” and “stupid”](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07SINGAPORE1932_a.html) or *same-thinking* our leaders are, reality has shifted around them and now the constrains are very different. What Kevin Rudd didn’t anticipate, what probably no one did, is that now, in a weird sense, the world is more feeling.



We now have a hardwired brain equivalence between your computer screen and what you see on the street for pretty much every person on tiers [2, 3, 4](https://www.gapminder.org/fw/income-levels/) ([and 5](https://medium.com/@RhysLindmark/a-critique-of-hans-roslings-factfulness-why-we-should-use-5-levels-instead-of-4-dccaac0440b4)). So [bombing Artsakh](https://twitter.com/zmnatsakanyan/status/1321539490041810948) or [burning cars](https://twitter.com/corinne_perkins/status/1266186713493385216) in your neighborhood now have a perceived realness within an order of magnitude of each other. This changes everything.



The flipside of leaders everywhere being constrained feelingness from everyone is that pretty much anyone anywhere has a shot at being paid attention to and taken seriously. Having money and going places is now scarcely a requirement for doing things. 



This is a new reality, and those who understand that sooner will set the tone and have a first movers advantage, with a disproportionate impact in subsequent global development. A founders effect perhaps not as great as the Pilgrims arriving in Plymouth, but probably on par with Kamehameha finding out that [cannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kepaniwai)  [are](https://www.historynet.com/kamehamehas-commandos.htm) [great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nu%CA%BBuanu).
