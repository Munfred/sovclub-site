Above: Praxis Temple, designed by the Praxis World Building Studio. Will this become a real place some day?



Dryden Brown, CEO of¬†[Praxis Society](https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=d3bd4dc3e0&e=09f1ce99cf), is coming in person to tell us about his attempt to build a new city from the ground up. In Praxis' own words:

*Praxis is a grassroots movement of modern pioneers building a new city. We are technologists and artists, builders and dreamers. We are building a place where we can develop to our fullest potentials, physically, culturally, and spiritually.*

And why are they building this new city? Because, according to them:

*Our civilization is unwell. We eat food that kills us, we‚Äôve lost sight of beauty, and we neglect our spiritual lives. The world is deranged and decayed, and this frightens people. We don‚Äôt look up from our screens; we seek to live within them. Crypto is a fundamentally political technology -- escape to the metaverse is a betrayal of the principles on which it was founded. We are descended from the people who built Rome and Athens, who dared to split atoms and voyage to the Moon. We can build new worlds not just of bits, but of atoms.*

And how are they planning to start building this new city? By building it online first:

*The correct approach to city building in this new world is demand-first (or as Balaji Srinivasan calls it, Cloud City first). We build the citizenry before the city. First, we create communities of true believers, organized around shared values, online. People move to cities for people, and it follows that if you collect a group of people who all want to live together, they‚Äôll all move together if at a moment in time everyone else does, too. Today, we have new tools. The emergence of Web3 enables us to supercharge communities with self-ownership, governance, and determination. Once you build a community of people ready to move to a new city together, you can self-finance the entire project. With something real to offer nations, conversations with governments become productive (e.g. Gigafactory). That‚Äôs how you make the risk dominoes fall.*

This Wednesday at Sovereignty Club, 6:00‚Äî7:30 pm, we'll challenge Dryden's claim that our civilization is in decay, and ask him to pin down the characteristics of his new city. What will be the basis of its economy? What will be its ideology? Will it be a communist utopia, a libertarian paradise, or a Puritan promised land? We'll hold a very informal discussion with the speaker and with each other, while sharing food and drinks.
