Hello, fellow aspiring sovereigns. We're glad you joined us.

\
**Our meeting will be this Wednesday, October 17, at 6pm**



It will be on BBB B101, at the Sovereignty Lounge (aka [Neurotechers](http://neurotechers.caltech.edu/) lounge, with whom we have a [compact of free association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_of_Free_Association)).\
It's pretty easy to get there, it's at the bottom floor of Beckman Behavioral Biology (BBB) as shown in the picture below.

**We have 3 topics in our agenda:**

1. **Introductions.** We're particularly curious to learn what youare interested on and topic ideas for the next meeting
2. **Current international events**, where you can share anything interesting going on
3. **Discussion** of this short article from Aeon about nation-states and city-states: [https://aeon.co/â€‹essays/the-end-of-a-world-of-â€‹nation-states-may-be-upon-us](https://aeon.co/essays/the-end-of-a-world-of-nation-states-may-be-upon-us)



**Finally, I would like to let you know about the [official](http://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/) ![ðŸš©](https://mail.google.com/mail/e/1f6a9)****[Sovereigntyâ€‹Forums](http://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/).**

That's right. Not only we have a wonderful website at [https://caltechsovereignty.â€‹club/](https://caltechsovereignty.club/), we have an \*independent\*, \*ad free\*, \*100% organic\*, \*fair trade\*,\*non-GMO\* and \*ethically sourced\* forum at [http://forum.â€‹caltechsovereignty.club/](http://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/). If you sign up for the forum, it's configured by default to send an email with new posts and comments as they happen (you can change it to your preferences), and you can reply directly from your email so that you don't even need to use the actual forum to participate in discussions.\
