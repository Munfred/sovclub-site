Little did we know, lo-and-behold, PLOTTWIST, mindblow, spoiler alert, surprise surprise bananaland actually *is* the land of the future. [The whole place is](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jMzChRfMDHmzOsAcbx-xWkCeiiBUT33-ssYqOlmRE0c/edit?usp=sharing). The complaints about it being a future that never arrived is indeed correct, they only missed the target. We had to wait for the rest of the world catching up.



This week we will talk about...

> *The West’s involution finds its mirror image in the original coun­try of the future, the nation doomed forever to remain the country of the future, the one that never reaches its destination: Bananaland. The Bananification of the world is our encounter with a future denied, and in which this frustration has become constitutive of our social reality. While the closing of historical horizons has often been a leftist, indeed Marxist, concern, the sense that things don’t work as they should is now widely shared across the political spectrum. Welcome to Bananaland. Here the only people satisfied with their situation are financial elites and venal politicians. Everyone complains, but everyone shrugs their shoulders. This slow degradation of society is not so much a runaway train, but more of a jittery rollercoaster, occasionally holding out promise of ascent, yet never break­ing free from the tracks. We always come back to where we started, shaken and disoriented, haunted by what might have been…*



These words are [not mine](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/author/alex-hochuli/). You see, nothing new under the sun. We at sovclub have always been visionaries, and it is only fair that eventually the rest of the world finally catches up, finally recognizing our genius and prowess.
