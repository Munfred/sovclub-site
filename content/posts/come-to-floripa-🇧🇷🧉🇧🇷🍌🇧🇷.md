# Because of immigration shenanigans, between November 22, 2022 and June, 2023 Eduardo will be back at his hometown, Florianópolis, best known as [Floripa](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=1c0175620a&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!8Pp5P7NWZmr5kUp4iQZR4bHXyxJ8GN8dLlADDw222GTraspOaPBafxOPGgM2ZRl7q_5Cu7cA41Mq-U3euodqtUVdrt8KlA$).

# Despite the fact that Floripa is a tropical paradise like Rio or Hawaii, this will not be just about enjoying the many many beaches of Floripa, doing hikes in lush nature, going to parties, eating lots of churrasco and drinking caipirinha, and visiting ultra authentic traditional cachaça distilleries (but there will be abundant opportunities for all of the above).This Wednesday Eduardo and Brener will be telling you why you should come to Floripa 

# \== You should come by. ==
