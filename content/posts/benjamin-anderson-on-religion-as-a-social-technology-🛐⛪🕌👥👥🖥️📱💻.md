**Religion as a Social technology****\
By [Benjamin Anderson](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=75b4518932&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!_4JH0iLPIg_VdnwYD_D-kwSNdfXE5oHZAtQOrg2_UQMhT-TQUItiwOaRGsovi6Ddf6lazq-0Acvv65c6n1Vyp40Nmsveyg$) from Articulate Ventures**

From Ben’s article “[A case for new Gods](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://club.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=270ee32bd9a552ddae66fd4f9&id=3145c8720d&e=ee534c915d__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!_4JH0iLPIg_VdnwYD_D-kwSNdfXE5oHZAtQOrg2_UQMhT-TQUItiwOaRGsovi6Ddf6lazq-0Acvv65c6n1Vyp41IMFhpkQ$)”

*I recently spent a week in Greece traveling between some of the most iconic constructed achievements in human history. These structures were by no coincidence erected in the territory where western thought originated.*

*In that time, the thought became obvious to me that each and every one of these monuments were not built for the sake of building or for the achievement itself. They were all structures erected to honor and pay respects to a higher form of being.*

*This thought prompted me to compare what we had built then to what we are building today. I realized the greatest creations today are not tributes or offerings to gods, they are tributes to humanity and its own achievements.*

*I spent a good deal of time contending with whether this was a good thing, a bad thing, or if it even mattered.*

**Join us as we discover Benjamin's conclusions and his understanding of religion as a social technology!**
