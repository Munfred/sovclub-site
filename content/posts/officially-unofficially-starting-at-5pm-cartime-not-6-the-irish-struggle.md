*\*\** Because of the end of daylight savings time for the foreseeable future we will starting our meetings at 5pm cartime, so that I might still be able to get a full night of sleep and wake up before noon. Until November 30 that will be officially happening in an unofficial capacity, due to our [deliberately ridiculous amendment process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2KZgRUbrxrfKcA5IiHkxdEK2Oe729vmSVcqMzSMovs/edit?usp=sharing) \*\***



At sovclub we frequently talk about ethnonationalism: when people that look (slightly) different fight over having their own state. Sometimes we also talk about vanilla nationalism: when people with (slightly) different political ideologies fight over having their own state. 



But what about when people who look the same and actually believe in the same political ideology are fighting about how...stately?...their state should be? What kind of *ism is that? ([answer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism))



Tonight we will talk about the Irish struggle for independence, and it *really* was a *struggle.* 



If you want to learn about precipitating factors for the Irish independence movement, check out [this 8 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT8uFIbNrHw), and if you want to learn how the civil war panned out, [watch this 14 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ8-2IMKezQ).



Spoiler: it was an unholy, very pointless, more than usual, mess.



See you at 5pm: [https://caltech.zoom.us/​j/4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668) \

In sovereignty,
