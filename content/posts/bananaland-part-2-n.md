Tonight we continue our odyssey towards the heart and soul of bananaland. Having covered history, we shall now cover Bananaland's defining economic and demographic feature: Inequality.

PS: Incidentally, this week I ran into a very interesting collection of "fanfic" banana balls, the purported radicalized remnants of banana factions after a protracted civil war. Of course, this is entirely fictional, because, as we discussed, bananas have no balls with which to do a civil war. Nevertheless, the factions seemed fairly representative of much of what we covered throughout banana history! (at least for me). Keys at the end.

1: The Classical-Stalinists/Leninists/Beriaists faction
2: Military hardliners back from their exile and other anticommunist nationalist right wing elements
3: Integralist/fascist faction within the hardliners' ranks, the republican integralists
4: Monarchist integralists
5: \[REDACTED]'s increasingly radical liberal revolutionaries
6: Provisional southern government, formed by exiled democratic leaders and separatists alike
7: Piratini nationalists
8: Isolated units of the army and military police, abusing their power and creating their own fiefdoms
9: Members of Dirceu's former government still loyal to it, opposed to the communists and militarists
10: Libertarian socialists mixed in with maoists and other types of communist trying to carve out their own piece of Brazil
