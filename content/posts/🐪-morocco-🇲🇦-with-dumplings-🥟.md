This week, Samy Meftoul, a Moroccan student at Pasadena City College, will tell us about his home country's history and culture.  Did you know that Morocco has two parallel civil institutions: one controlled by the king, one elected democratically?  Or that a [coup d'etat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Moroccan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt "https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Moroccan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt") was foiled when the king grabbed a radio and told the attackers "Stop firing! The tyrant is dead!"?  This is also your chance to ask questions about Morocco's culture, history, and religion.

Also this week is Chinese New Year, which happens on Feb 1.  This is usually celebrated by eating dumplings at a family dinner the evening before the new year (i.e. right about now), but Sovereignty Club doesn't meet today and we're all far from our families.  So, we'll have dumplings on Wednesday instead.
