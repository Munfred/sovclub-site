Lasting and functional institutions are a crucial aspect for stable societies and any kind successful nation building. Over the past 200 or so years, *scientific* institutions became a staple for attaining global power and influence, as technology became the peanut butter and jelly of military and economic superiority. Different strokes for different folks, but some people are not satisfied with the scientific institutions currently serving us:

> *[New Science](< https://newscience.org/>) aims to build new institutions of basic science, starting with the life sciences.*
>
> *Over the next several decades, New Science will create a network of new scientific institutes pursuing basic research while not being dependent on universities, the NIH, and the rest of traditional academia and, importantly, not being dominated culturally by academia.*
>
> *Our goal is not to replace universities, but to develop complementary institutions and to provide the much needed “competitive pressure” on the existing ones and to prevent their further ossification. New Science will do to science what Silicon Valley did to entrepreneurship.*
>
> *\-*  https://newscience.org/

Like myself, many of those in the audience will be left wondering *what on earth do they mean by that*. To find out, I reached out to [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/), one of the people driving newscience.org, and asked him to come explain it to sovclub. And he agreed!

So next Wednesday, May 26 at 6PM cartime, Alexey will come explain us what do they actually want to do. But before then, I thought it would be fun if we took a stab at designing our own scientific institutions! Sovsci if you will.

So tonight we will discuss what would YOU like to see in academic and scientific institutions. 

* What do you like about current institutions, and what do you not like? 
* What would you do differently?
* How would you design your institutions so that they last, instead of [blowing up or something](https://www.coindesk.com/55m-hack-ethereum-down)?
* How could you implement these changes? 
* Would you adapt existing institutions, or start from scratch? 
* How would you get people onboard with doing things differently?

Think about that, take a look at [https://newscience.org/](https://newscience.org/,), and come discuss!

Oh and by the way, absolutely DO tell your friends Alexey Guzey is coming to sovcall next Wednesday.  You can even give them this link: https://www.caltechsovereignty.club/new-science-warmup-come-tell-us-how-youd-like-scientific-institutions-to-be(very self referential, I know)

See you at 6PM cartime at at https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668 (or at least next week, I hope!)

In sovereignty,

Eduardo
