Back in ye olden days, to get published in a media outlet, your screams into the void needed to go thorough some dude that called himself a prophet and approved to be put into his big book. After some time when more and more people wanted the masses to listen to their screams into the void, the role of prophet was passed onto a distinguished class of people we know today as editors, gatekeepers of their respective publications. While these publications used to be delivered by mail, where in the US, a person "had the right as a citizen to receive mail at his business, regardless of whether people agreed with it," at least according toÂ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Abram_Weltmer "https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Abram_Weltmer"), whose Nevada Daily Mail source didn't cite its sources, mass communication today has become more and more controlled by a small number of private companies not bound by the first amendment's restriction on the government, including the one I manage.



As noted in a previous email (ðŸ“°ðŸ–‹ðŸ¤”ðŸ™€ðŸ—£Our new propaganda outletðŸ¤­ðŸ¤«ðŸ˜ˆðŸ“°), I currently hold the elected position of the editor of Caltech's fairly dormant student newspaper The California Tech, a position whose power I haveÂ [abused](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mcy82lqPq5TFxDPM3VlICppH1JsYUkkw/view?usp=sharing "https\://drive.google.com/file/d/1mcy82lqPq5TFxDPM3VlICppH1JsYUkkw/view?usp=sharing")Â [multiple](https://tech.caltech.edu/issues/124-2 "https\://tech.caltech.edu/issues/124-2")Â [times](https://tech.caltech.edu/issues/124-3 "https\://tech.caltech.edu/issues/124-3").



While we may at first glance appear to be a "real" newspaper (at least when we were printing physical issues), one thing sets us apart from our traditional media counterparts: it's run by people that have no idea what they're doing (see: me) for little to no pay. When it comes to finding writers that are passionate and willing to speak openly about their stories, figuring out what the publication's stance should be on current events, and the now more relevant than ever question of who to give the platform to, our responses to all of these have been a collectiveÂ *shrugs.*Â As we are technically a media outlet during a turbulent time when the President has been deplatformed by big tech, finding ways to address these questions might soon be important. After all, Devin might be running for reelection soon and really could use some fluff on his candidate statement.



\- Should we do anything about the self-selection bias of a volunteer workforce of journalists pushing the publication to more extreme views due to the "get what you're searching for" nature of the internet?

\- Should we make any attempts to get a more diverse set of views represented in the Tech, and how could we even do it?

\- How should we determine whether or not something has gone out of line and become unworthy of publication?

\- Or should we accept the inevitable fate of our paper becoming an echo chamber like traditional media has become?



Feel free to yell the correct answers to our dumb faces at 6PM cartime!

To populist authoritarianism!

(btw, unlike Twitter who can follow its mission statement, "to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers" when it is convenient for the company and its shareholders, we are still elected employees by the members of our parent company, the Associated Students of the California Institute of Technology and so we do have at least some level of accountability to them and the mostly unenforced bylaws we're technically bound by.)
