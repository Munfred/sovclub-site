Tomorrow **bullshit will start at the usual time (6pm) BUT at a slightly different place**: just outside Sovereignty Lounge, at the [Beckman Institute Courtyard, next to the gene pool](https://gsc.caltech.edu/files/2019/03/DSC_3386.jpg). The reason for this is that there is a BE happy hour going on (starting at 5pm) so in order to save money and get a break from pizza, you are all cordially invited. At 6:30pm or so we shall transition to the Sovereignty Lounge sofa for the presentation.\

Hopefully we'll get around to talking about Kofi this time, [check the post from last week if you didn't read it](https://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/t/november-16-the-baddest-ass-kofi-annan-secretary-general/152/2) (I know you didn't).\
\
I strongly recommend this excerpt from Kofi's book where he describes [what is basically a sovclub meeting](https://pastebin.com/WDBC41EM), except instead of Stick Fight it ends with Iraq Fight.



Now, I know that you're all very sad that I'm writing such a short email. So, in order to give you something to read, I'd like to share some articles on what is going on at Hong Kong, which I was planning to discuss at BS time anyways:

* **12 Nov:** [The Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49317695) (don't worry, they have links to more words)
* **14 Nov:** [Is There Even A Point to Comparing Singapore to Hong Kong?](https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-comparing-singapore-hong-kong/) (answer: yes because this guy just did and the article is fantastic)
* **19 Nov:** [U.S. Senate Passes Hong Kong Democracy Bill, Drawing China‚Äôs Ire](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-19/u-s-senate-unanimously-passes-bill-backing-hong-kong-protesters) ([Not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act) [the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Relations_Act#:~:targetText=An%20act%20to%20help%20maintain,Taiwan%2C%20and%20for%20other%20purposes.) [first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States%E2%80%93Hong_Kong_Policy_Act) [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Travel_Act))
* **20 Nov (HK time):** [Hong Kong mask law: Beijing claim on ‚Äòunconstitutional‚Äô ruling could spell end of ‚Äòone country, two systems‚Äô, legal heavyweights warn](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3038479/hong-kong-mask-law-beijing-claim-unconstitutional-ruling) (waaa)

Cheers

PS: If you have friends intimately familiar with the Hong Kong events, now is the time to cajole them into coming to sovclub.



PSS: Due to a string of trips, for this year I can only preside over 3 more meetings: Nov 20, Nov 27 and Dec 4. Feel free to throw a coup in my absence, Dylan would be thrilled.
