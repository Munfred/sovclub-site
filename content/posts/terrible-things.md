Uncertainty and bad things happening can be stressing. In order to reduce your stress and preserve your mental health, [the CDC recommends not watching news](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html).



At Sovereignty Club we prize our members sanity, so this week we'll be discussing [this heartwarming article that is not about coronavirus](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-mega-wars-that-shaped-world-history/)!

\
It's an excerpt from the lovely titled book *“Global Catastrophes and Trends: The Next Fifty Years”* by [Vaclav Smil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaclav_Smil). I am attaching the full book in case you get excited, but I haven't read it.

So in order to take our minds off current events (bullshit time exempted), please think about your favourite terrible thing that has happened or will happen and let's talk about it!



Here's the link for the meeting: [https://caltech.zoom.us/j/​4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)



As usual, come hangout with us at Sovereignty Virtual Lounge: [https://discord.gg/​fpwzzBt](https://discord.gg/fpwzzBt)



In sovereignty,
