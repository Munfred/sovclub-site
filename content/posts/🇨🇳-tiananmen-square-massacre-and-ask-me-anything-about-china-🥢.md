This week, an anonymous speaker will talk about the ‘89 democracy movement in China (八九民运) (otherwise known as the June 4th incident, or the Tiananmen square massacre) -- one of the most important events in modern Chinese history but virtually non-existent on any history books in China. Rather than presenting the facts (which you can find on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests_and_massacre "https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests_and_massacre")), the speaker wishes to share how their personal understanding evolved over a decade about this watershed moment. The presentation will be half an hour from 6:30 pm to 7 pm, followed by a 30-minute ask-me-anything session about the presentation and about China.  As always, 6:00--6:30 pm is "bullshit period", where we discuss international news.
