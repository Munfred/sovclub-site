As we [have previously discussed](https://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/t/august-14-the-un/136), the structure of the world's foremost international body, rather than being the manifest destiny of the future of nations, is the crystalized embodiment of the geopolitical realities of the world as it was \*exactly\* at the end of the second great war. There were to be [four policemen of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Policemen), and they'd split the world exactly [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Policemen#/media/File:FourPolicemenZones.png), and nobody else should have weapons because they were either too small, or on the wrong side, or already owned by Britain. Except de Gaulle was such a charming guy Britain nagged America to let France in the club.



And so the United Nations was born! Five members were special, everyone else was unspecial. Of course, right off the bat, the "nobody else should have weapons" thing fizzled, but the five policemen stuck with their "veto powers". Then India was let loose, but never-mind that. Then China flipped sides, but never-mind that, let's just pretend it didn't until we can't anymore. Then the best empire crumbled (üò¢)...together with every other empire, opening the floodgates of hell nationhood...then the soviets let go of their colonies in a final wave of nation creation, and since then things kinda have calmed down for a while. In 75 years the number of unspecial nations went from 46 to 188 (plus change).



If you think it‚Äôs weird the club rules have essentially not changed and tying things back to geopolitical reality might be a good idea, you are also not alone. To their credit, the UN is doing a lot better than their predecessor. Yet who knows what reform might bring, perhaps even incentivize some members to be more (positively) proactive! But that‚Äôs certainly not easy.



That difficulty is compounded by the (unsurprising) fact that the UN has a [myriad of autonomous organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_specialized_agencies_of_the_United_Nations) working under its umbrella, each of which has an idiosyncratic history and (on the order of) 200 idiosyncratic members that often hate each other, as well as prospective members.



Tonight we‚Äôll (literally) rethink the UN, together with one of it‚Äôs agencies, WHO has been on [the](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/who-chief-tedros-in-the-eye-of-the-storm-12746058) [news](http://youtube.com/watch?v=UlCYFh8U2xM) [a](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-52088167) [lot](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52289056) [lately](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3085013/trump-threatens-who-permanent-freeze-over-coronavirus-response). Which, by the way, is governed by the [WHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Assembly), a fortuitous acronym that enabled the perfect pun in the title.



Our mandate tonight is to pretend we could change anything (lol, I know) describe whatever wonky structures we dream up that might improve the workings of the UN and the WHO, given our (very) patchy knowledge about how they operate. Bonus points to whoever points out flaws in the other person‚Äôs argument (we should get a squeaky sound button on zoom....). Anything goes: Power structure, funding mechanism, focus priorities. And DOUBLE bonus points for anyone who can think of a way to actually enticing the current members into transitioning to the wonky new deal.



I‚Äôll start, since nobody is going to read this far into such a late sent email:



First, I'd put the UN voting on resolutions and membership status on the blockchain. There should be a way to implement this that will actually streamline the whole process while making it more transparent and enabling a bunch of new features. For example, we now could do secret voting, for issues where bullying is a big deal (eg Taiwan).



Now that we can use smart contracts and computers, voting will be done using‚Ä¶ [QUADRATIC VOTING](https://forum.caltechsovereignty.club/t/2020-05-06-quadratic-voting-and-quadratic-funding-c/171)! Voting credits will be proportional to how much money a member state contributed to the UN or one of it's agencies. There should be a starting floor for voting (eg a dollar or a million dollars worth of voting creds, so that you can't just sway every vote on trivialities nobody has strong feelings about).



This way if a new issue you care a lot about comes up and you're out of creds, you give the UN money and sway the voting. Issues should be left open for voting for a long time window (I'm thinking 6 months) to allow time for the bidding wars. Things that need fast and decisive action are a problem‚Ä¶ But they always are, it's not like they're dealt with swiftly under the current scheme. Remember that quadratic voting allows for negative voting too! Ideally, this should allow us to replace veto powers (but in practice I don't know how to convince the policemen to relinquish that power‚Ä¶).



Now, how does all that donated money gets allocated? QUADRATIC FUNDING! Yep. Within each agency, the distribution of money is decided with quadratic voting (again subject to a floor of voting creds) according to how much money each country donated to them.



Now, an interesting thing that happens with UN agencies is that you often have private entities working with them, or giving them money. The best known example is the [Bill and Melina Gates foundation, which gives a ton of money to WHO programs](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/who-funds-world-health-organization-un-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-trump/) and is actually second only to the US. Under current practices, private entities can donate money or resources, and dictate how they should be allocated, often causing allocation imbalances (donors want to know they're donating to shiny things, and have a tendency to neglect boring but important things).



To fix that, which come people condemn as undue influence of companies (because corporations are evil, unlike nations naturally) instead of dictating directly where their funds should go or participating in the quadratic voting itself (which would only spur the creation of shell companies and extra identities to game the system), private entities can instead make their donation count towards the voting creds of any member state of their liking. So, if you want to eradicate polio, you donate a billion dollars to the WHO, then split the voting creds towards members that will vote as you want. Yes, under this scheme you can split the voting creds among many members, which is kind of manipulation, but also a) unavoidable, so might as well make it official and regulate it, like lobbying and campaign donations, and b) actually probably good because in practice you may end up boosting the influence of poor but contractually honest nations. Everyone wins!



The interesting thing with this scheme is that it could be applied to any UN agency, not just the WHO! In one go we dampen dictatorial influence of big guys, boost small but honest countries with aligned priorities, and stimulate civil society participation in international affairs and making the world a better place! What could go wrong?



You tell me!



See you soon,



Eduardo



PS: As evidenced from the fact that first came the pun, then the discussion topic to fit it, we don't have more topics lined up for the coming weeks. So if you have an idea of something to present, PLEASE TELL ME. thx.
