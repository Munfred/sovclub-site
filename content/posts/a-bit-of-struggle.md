So, coincidentally, starting at 6pm cartime tonight, America is having another [struggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struggle_session) [session](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/07/politics/vice-presidential-debate-tonight/index.html). I'm not sure we'd be able to endure the whole thing, but we might peek.



Instead, allow me to tell you about happier things. As you might have heard, last week we got a [new budding war](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2020-10-01/why-armenia-and-azerbaijan-are-brink-war) (well ok maybe not [so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict) [new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS3P9kk-vFk)). Given how [uneventful](https://www.caltechsovereignty.club/something-is-happening) most of our lives have been, we figured that it would nice and uplifting to talk about the [Nagorno-Karabakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh) conflict. We'll do that officially next week, if Armenia doesn't [cave in](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/6/assad-calls-erdogan-the-main-instigator-in-in-nagorno-karabakh) before then.



See you in 40 minutes
