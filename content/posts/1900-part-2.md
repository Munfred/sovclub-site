Tonight at [20h puritan time](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/797256296612364299/807757076905459732/puritan_time_zone.png?width=705&height=482) we will continue watching the mega epic Italian film [1900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900_(film)). We stopped around the 2 hour mark last time so if you didn't start watching it yet, tough luck. But seriously, despite being insanely long (317 minutes!!!111!!12) it is....oddly engrossing?...for a movie that is about a time when everything was slower, and which *really* takes it's time, you know. It feels like they're telling you the story, but in absolute no rush to tell the story, and somehow you are ok with it. You'd expect that us, creatures from the information age, grown with computers and now bred with social media, wouldn't have the attention span to deal with it. So yeah, watch it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/1900-Robert-Niro/dp/B003PX6Z7G) at your own pace.\
