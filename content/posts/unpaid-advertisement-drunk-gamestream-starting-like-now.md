Hello friends. This is not about countries, this is about wielding power. This is about misappropriating a mailing list because you can.

I have drank 2.7 beers and plan on drinking a couple more before the night is over. We would like to invite you to a drunk gamestream, where I play Disco Elysium for the first time ever over zoom:

I tried setting it up with twitch, but turns out the lag is unbearable.

Join us!
