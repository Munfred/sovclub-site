Hello sovclub,



Last week, I got through only 7 of my 27 slides because everyone asked a lot of good questions. Not wanting to discourage questions, I decided to divide my talk into a multi-part series. So tune in tomorrow to hear about the Gracchi brothers, populists bent on redistributing land to poor farmers. Also, what do you do when 300,000 potentially hostile nomads just show up on your doorstep one day? Or when your name appears on a public list of enemies that every citizen is permitted to kill?



If you didn't join last week but want to join this week, I attached my slides. Make sure to only look at slides 1 to 7 if you want to avoid spoilers.



Join us tomorrow at 6 pm Pacific: [https://caltech.zoom.â€‹us/j/4359087668](https://caltech.zoom.us/j/4359087668)





Cheers,



Michael
